<p>In the following pages is presented a number of the more timely
papers and addresses of the year 1909 on the present railway situation,
together with chapters from two books of current interest on
the same subject. As the object of the compilation has been to
present in permanent and accessible form information in regard to
American railways worthy of more than the ephemeral life of newspaper
or pamphlet publication, it has been thought well to accompany
the messages of today with a brief glance at the conditions on
this continent before the days of railways. Happily for this purpose
the first two chapters of Messrs. Cleveland and Powell's "Railroad
Promotion and Capitalization in the United States," fresh
from the press, afforded the very background needed, and the first
report of the engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad provided the
glasses through which the reader can look forward from the small
beginnings to what is now known as the greatest railway system
on the globe.</p>

<p>After this study of conditions as they were, and of the opportunities
that invited the railway pioneers of 1848, it is instructive to
read the utterances of the latest of our empire builders, whose foresight
and indomitable will anticipated the development of our
Pacific Northwest with railway facilities that already lag behind
the necessities of its amazing growth.</p>

<p>Of the other addresses and papers it is unnecessary to say more
than that they reflect the prevailing sentiments of all thoughtful
railway officials respecting conditions of the gravest import to the
great industry upon which the entire fabric of our national prosperity
and well-being depends. Only the shallowest student of our
social, economic and political system can view the persistent attacks
upon the American system of transportation without serious alarm
for the results. This alarm is the prevailing note of these papers
and it comes from men who are at the helm and who see the financial
breakers upon which the fierce blasts of political exigency are
driving the railways.</p>

<p>The papers by Sir George S. Gibbs and Mr. A. M. Acworth, the
leading authorities on British railways, discuss the alternative to
wisely regulated railways&mdash;nationalization of railways. With a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
continuance of unwise and burdensome regulation of railways, which
strips responsibility of all discretion, nationalization is inevitable.</p>

<p>The Bureau's statistics of American railways for the year ending
June 30, 1909, is included in <span class="smcap">The Railway Library</span> because it

States but for the world.</p>

<p>Inland transportation, as we know it, is the product of the last
century. It had its beginning in the industrial revolution. In England
at the close of the eighteenth century the manor as a productive
agency had been supplanted by a system of domestic production,
and this in turn was giving place to the factory. The combined
influences of increasing capital and invention had operated
to centralize the industrial population in the towns. Ocean commerce
was comparatively well developed, and manufacture was fast
being established upon a modern basis; but inland transportation
was still encumbered by such primitive methods as to make difficult
the utilization of the resources of the interior. A century and
a half before, Lord Bacon had called attention to the three great
elements necessary to make a nation great and prosperous&mdash;"a fertile
soil, busy workshops, and easy conveyance of men and things
from one place to another,"&mdash;but the significance of this reflection
was not appreciated until after the middle of the eighteenth century.
The controlling force of custom&mdash;social inertia&mdash;had stood
in the way of progress.</p>


<p class="pfs80">IN ENGLAND.</p>

<p>Until about the opening of the nineteenth century the principal
manufacturing towns of Great Britain were situated on or near the
coast; for in the inland country goods were still carried on the
backs of men, or hauled in carts over heavy roads. Said Lardner:
"The internal transport of goods in England was performed by
wagon, and was not only intolerably slow, but so expensive as to
exclude every object except manufactured articles, and such as,
being of light weight and small bulk in proportion to their value,
would allow of a high rate of transport. Thus the charge for carriage
by wagon from London to Leeds was at the rate of £13
($63.31) a ton, being 13½d. (27 cents) per ton per mile. Between
Liverpool and Manchester it was 40s. ($9.60) a ton, or 15d. (30
cents) per ton per mile. Heavy articles, such as coal and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
materials, could only be available for commerce where their position
favored transport by sea, and, consequently, many of the richest
districts of the kingdom remained unproductive, awaiting the
tardy advancement of the art of transport."</p>


<p class="pfs80">IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution the American colonists lived in almost complete
isolation. Travel by land was limited, for water communication
presented fewer obstacles to progress. Population was arranged
along the seaboard, or in isolated groups a short distance inland.
Living narrow, self-centered lives, each community developed a
distinct dialect and characteristic customs and dress. Social activities
were limited to going to mill, market and church, or exchanging
friendly calls; traveling on foot or on horseback along wooded
trails. Even between seacoast towns there was little interchange of
products or population; and a citizen of one colony going to another
was at once struck with the many local peculiarities. It was
less than twenty years before the Revolutionary war when the
first stage line was opened between New York and Philadelphia,
and three days were then required for a single trip. It was ten
years later when the first stage line was established between Philadelphia
and Baltimore.</p>


<p class="pfs80">METHODS OF TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT.</p>

<p>Between towns of considerable size there were country roads
over which vehicles could pass when the weather would permit.
The stage coach, which was the only public land conveyance, plied
along the coast and between a few inland centers, but the coaches
of that day were rude boxes swung on wheels by leathern straps
instead of springs, with seats for a dozen or more and accommodations
for a limited amount of baggage. The rate of travel was
from two to six miles an hour, according to the condition of the
roads and the importance of the route. On the farm the mud-boat
or stone sledge was in common use, and at times it was even
employed to carry produce to local markets. In more progressive
communities two-wheeled carts and wagons were to be found. The
best of roads, however, were nothing but "mud roads"; and the
wagons, commonly of the linchpin type, were clumsy and awkward.
Some of the more primitive wagons had wheels made of cross
sections of trees, trimmed and centered to roll on axles of wood.
Those who traveled had little thought of time; companionship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
found expression in story-telling, gossip and tippling; and an emergency
which required all to get out and "take a wheel" only added
spice to the trip.</p>

<p>We have the following description of the roads about Philadelphia,
the metropolis and commercial center of the New World:
"On the best lines of communication the ruts were deep, the descents
precipitous. * * * Near the great cities the state of the
roads was so bad as to render all approach difficult and dangerous.
Out of Philadelphia a quagmire of black mud covered a long stretch
of road near the village of Rising Sun. There horses were often
seen floundering in the mud up to their bellies. On the York road,
long lines of wagons were every day to be met with, drawn up near
Logan's hill, while the wagoners unhitched their teams, to assist
each other in pulling through the mire. At some places, stakes were
set up to warn teams of the quicksand pits; at others, the fences
were pulled down, and a new road made through the fields." Transportation
facilities were either entirely lacking or such as to make
travel both expensive and hazardous. It is difficult to realize that
as late as 1780 the roads over a large part of Pennsylvania were
narrow paths which had been made through the woods by Indians
and traders.</p>


<p class="pfs80">ABSENCE OF ROADS IN THE INTERIOR.</p>

<p>The isolation of interior settlements finds apt illustration in the
Wyoming valley. This rich region along the Susquehanna had
been until 1786 almost completely cut off from the outer world.
A small colony had moved in from the East, and taking color of
title from Connecticut, disclaimed the sovereignty of the Quaker
proprietary. War consequently broke out between this isolated settlement
and the Pennsylvania government. Several military expeditions
were sent out to reduce the "Yankees" to submission; but
the absence of roads and the necessity of carrying provisions on
horseback left the determined pioneers masters of the situation
when the larger issue, the Revolutionary war, suspended local strife.
The spring after Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga the settlers of
the Wyoming valley learned that a detachment of Johnson's "Royal
Greens" and Butler's "Rangers," with a company of Tories, had
allied themselves with the Seneca Indians, and were preparing to
descend upon the valley. A courier was despatched to congress,
and appeals for aid were made to the neighboring states, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
isolation which had before served for defense now brought disaster.
With the June freshet the British allies came down from Tioga,
and nothing but ruins were left to mark the scene. One of the
reasons urged for the removal of the state capitol from Philadelphia
to Harrisburg in 1799 was the cost of travel, which bore heavily
upon legislators from the interior.</p>


<p class="pfs80">THE ROADS OF NEW ENGLAND.</p>

<p>The early settlers of Springfield, Massachusetts, were obliged to
send their household goods from Roxbury around by way of Long
Island Sound and the Connecticut river, but they themselves were
able to proceed on foot along an Indian trail. In time this trail was
widened, and as the "Bay path" and the "Boston road" occupied
an important place among the transportation routes of the colonies.
It was, however, little more than a narrow wagon path until after
the Revolution, and so indistinct was it that travelers frequently
wandered off the route. A curious stone post marks the place near
the national armory at Springfield, where in 1763 a western Massachusetts
merchant lost his way, and set up a guide for other travelers.
Even as late as 1795 there were but two stages between Boston
and New York, and a week was required for the journey. John
Bernard, the English actor, thus described a typical New England
road in 1797: "Though far better than in any other quarter of the
Union, the frequent jolts and plunges of the vehicle brought it into
sad comparison with the bowling-greens of England. Very often
we surprised a family of pigs taking a bath in a gully of sufficient
compass to admit the coach. As often, such chasms were filled
with piles of stones that, at a distance, looked like Indian tumuli.
The driver's skill in steering was eminent. I found there were
two evils to be dreaded in New England traveling&mdash;a clayey soil
in wet weather, which, unqualified with gravel, made the road a
canal; and a sandy one in summer, which might emphatically be
called an enormous insect preserve." Such testimony makes real
the difficulties which attended travel over the important routes, and
enables one to understand how it could have required Washington
nearly two weeks to make the trip from Philadelphia to Cambridge
at the outbreak of the Revolution.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AFTER THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.</p>

<p>Before the Revolution the subject of road improvement was
seldom considered in public assemblies, and the early laws contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
few provisions even for common roads. Those who proposed measures
for general improvement met with little encouragement. As
early as 1690 William Penn suggested the practicability of a waterway
from the Schuylkill to the Susquehanna. In 1762 David Rittenhouse
of Philadelphia, and Provost Smith of the University of
Pennsylvania, proposed a similar project, and made surveys of the
route by the Swatara and the Tulpehocken; in 1769 the American
Philosophical Society interested itself in a canal survey between
Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware, recommending the enterprise
to the public. In 1768 Governor Moore of New York projected
a canal around the Canajoharie Falls of the Mohawk. But to none
of these suggestions was there any active response, for the time
was not ripe for such undertakings.</p>

<p>Contributing to the road-making impulse immediately after the
war of independence was a newly awakened community interest.
At the time of the adoption of the constitution there were two distinct
classes in the United States: a highly localized class of the
seaboard and of the inland trade routes, and a widely distributed
agricultural class. American commerce was largely confined to
American products. England, France and Holland monopolized
the trade of their colonies, and in other ways favored their own
merchantmen in foreign trade. Such being the condition, our commercial
advantage lay in the development of our own resources.
The settlement of the Middle Atlantic states and of the valleys of
the interior only served to strengthen the interdependence of the
people, who found a common interest in internal improvements. To
the agriculturist, cheap conveyance to market was a prerequisite to
profitable industry. To the commercial class on the seaboard and
on the leading trade routes, inland improvement was at that time
no less important.</p>


<p class="pfs80">FIRST ERA OF ROAD MAKING.</p>

<p>There was a notable change in the popular attitude toward road
making after the war, and all public-spirited men now saw in better
means of communication an instrument for the establishing of
American supremacy over the western continent. Legislatures
made generous appropriations for highways. An active migration
set in from New York and northern Pennsylvania to the West.
In 1738 the first regular mail service was established between
Albany and Schenectady. In 1793 the horse path from Albany to
the Connecticut valley was widened to a wagon road. Like activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in road making was shown throughout southern and western New
York, middle Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.</p>

<p>In 1785 Pennsylvania appropriated $10,000 to lay out a road
from a point near the mouth of the Juanita to Pittsburgh. In
1786 an act was passed appropriating $1,500 "to view and open a
road from Lehigh Water Gap to Wyoming," which was the first
road into that valley from the Delaware. In 1787 another road
was authorized between the Susquehanna and the Delaware. Activity
in opening communication with the interior increased until by
1791 the movement had assumed proportions to be styled a "mania."
By a single act over $150,000 was appropriated for the improvement
of eleven rivers and over a score of roads in different parts
of the state. Other acts were passed at the same session, granting
charters and appropriations for various transportation enterprises.
New York in 1797 authorized the raising by <em>lotteries</em> of $45,000
for the improvement of various roads throughout the state. As if
by common impulse, all the states now became interested in road
improvement, and congress was asked to aid by this means the
opening up of the resources of the interior.</p>


<p class="pfs80">BEGINNING OF THE CANALS AND PIKES.</p>

<p>The low cost of water transportation had early directed popular
attention to canals as a means of overcoming obstructions in natural
water courses, thereby serving the needs of the inland population,
and also providing the means for diverting trade from one
seaport to another. The Revolutionary war was hardly over when
Charles Carroll organized a company to open a canal about the
obstructions in the lower Susquehanna.</p>

<p>Those who took the most active interest in canal construction at
this time were men who, like Washington, viewed the future with
patriotic interest. This interest, however, was one which did not
appeal to the private investor. An enterprise based upon such public
consideration required government support.</p>

<p>This period also marked the beginning of turnpike construction.
The first turnpike road in this country of which we have a record
was built between Alexandria and the Lower Shenandoah. It
was begun in 1785-6, and its completion was the cause of great
satisfaction to Jefferson and other public-spirited men of Virginia,
who had labored in the cause of a "broader national life." Alexandria
was at that time an important competitor of the other seaboard
cities. Across the Maryland peninsula on the Chesapeake lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Baltimore, a commercial rival of both Alexandria and Philadelphia.
In 1787 the grand jury sitting at Baltimore called attention to the
deplorable condition of the roads leading to that city, and urged
the authorities to take immediate action. As a result, the county
government ordered the old Frederick, Reistertown and York roads
turnpiked at public expense. To the west of Philadelphia lay the
Susquehanna valley. The natural outlet of this growing region
was down the Chesapeake to Baltimore. To attract traffic to the
Quaker City a company was organized in Philadelphia in 1792 to
build the Lancaster pike, which was the first turnpike in this country
built by voluntary subscription.</p>


<p class="pfs80">EFFECT OF EUROPEAN WARS ON AMERICAN SITUATION.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the European wars in 1793 was followed by a
marked change in the American industrial situation. The immediate
effect upon the grain growing of the West was to increase the
demand for wheat. Prices of cereals rose to twice their former
height. The average price of flour during the seven years from
1785 to 1793 had been about $5.40 a barrel; the average price
from 1793 to 1806 (the two years of peace, 1802 and 1803, excluded)
was $9.12. Such was the inducement to grain growing during
this period.</p>

<p>Back from the North Atlantic coast radiated rich valleys&mdash;large
tracts of agricultural lands which were well adapted to grain growing.
A rush set in for the unclaimed resources of New York,
Pennsylvania and Maryland, and for a time the tide of migration
moved to the westward along the Ohio, and the border of the
Great Lakes. Those who cultivated lands near the coast shared
in the increased prosperity due to the European disturbance, but
unless they could obtain better means of transportation, those who
had located inland soon found that they could profit little. Grain
as compared with cotton and tobacco was a low priced product.
At best, the cost of transportation was ten dollars a ton for each
hundred-mile haul; in many places it was much higher.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AMERICANS TURN TO HOME MARKETS.</p>

<p>Before 1807 the country had come to be divided into three sections:
the commercial, shipbuilding East, the cotton and tobacco
exporting South, and the isolated grain growing interior, linked
with which was a languishing manufacturing interest on or near
the seaboard. Beyond a limited range the producing proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of our population could not participate in the profits of the European
trade. The grain growers demanded a market, and the manufacturers
saw their profits swept away by an influx of foreign
goods. These were the interests which suffered from the diversion
of capital to shipbuilding and foreign trade. Both looked to
internal improvements as a solution of their troubles; their only
hope was in a <em>home market</em>&mdash;in better roads, and in the development
of the resources about them.</p>

<p>In the United States agriculturist and manufacturer turned to
the national government for relief. But so long as the administration
remained in the hands of the foreign trade party, the way
was blocked to internal improvements. During the first three administrations
after the adoption of the constitution, the individualistic
republicans had been unable to gain control of the government;
but with the admission of Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio
and the settlement of the parts of the sea coast states remote from
transportation facilities, the anti-commercial constituency gained
the balance of power. It was to the voters of these new regions
that Jefferson owed his success. It was to satisfy the demands of
the West for an outlet to the gulf that Louisiana was purchased. To
satisfy the insistent demand for internal improvements the national
government also built the Cumberland road, and contributed to
many other transportation projects. It was the open hostility of
the West and South toward the commercial East which forced
the embargo, and broke down the domination of the seaboard interests
in national affairs.</p>


<p class="pfs80">RIVER TRAFFIC DEVELOPED BY PRIVATE CAPITAL.</p>

<p>The inland routes which required the least capital to utilize in a
primitive way were the rivers. Here the chief obstacle was the
current. In the early nineteenth century long lines of rafts, flat-boats
and "arks" might be seen floating down the Connecticut, the
Hudson, the Susquehanna and the Potomac. There were 2,800 miles
of rivers tributary to the Atlantic seaboard which were navigable,
or which needed only to be cleared of snags and rocks to render
them available for use by small craft. It was estimated that on the
eastern slope there were about 25,000 miles of streams which might
be utilized by the construction of locks and canals. In the Mississippi
valley there were 14,000 miles of navigable rivers, and
about 75,000 more which were considered possibilities. But with
a three or four-mile current it was impracticable to row, pole or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
warp a boat and cargo upstream for a long distance. The result
was that along those streams which nature had provided as highways
the producer first built his boat out of the timbers of the
forest, then loaded it with the produce of his farm or mill, and
floated down stream to market. Upon reaching his destination,
he abandoned his craft and returned by stage or on foot. This
was indeed an expensive process&mdash;expensive in time, expensive in
funds and expensive in human effort. It was an expense of production,
however, and one which did not require capitalization.</p>

<p>It was not until 1807 that the steamboat became a commercial
success. At this time New York was becoming well settled, and
as the Hudson was a natural highway a boat which could drive
against wind and stream had every promise of success. Robert
Fulton, who had been interested in the problem of steam navigation
since 1802, returned from Europe after several years of investigation,
and brought back one of Watt's engines. He obtained the
financial co-operation of Chancellor Livingston, and together they
obtained a monopoly of steam navigation in New York waters. A
boat was fitted with the Watt engine, and a successful trip was
made from New York to Albany and return. The route yielded
large profits from the start, and other boats were built. By 1813
six boats were doing a profitable business on the Hudson. The
success of Fulton and Livingston proved attractive to others.
Crowded out of New York's waters by the monopoly, John Stevens,
in 1809, took a steamboat around from Hoboken into the Delaware.
The Phoenix now found business so good in those waters where
Fitch had failed that it was soon followed by two other boats.
Soon the whole Atlantic seaboard, including the St. Lawrence, was
supplied with steam craft.</p>

<p>But enterprise in steamboat navigation was not confined to the
coast. Business opportunities in the Mississippi valley attracted
the attention of one Nicholas Roosevelt, who proposed to Fulton
and Livingston that he would make a trip to New Orleans to survey
the prospects for an inland water route, with the understanding
that they should finance a steamboat line if his report was favorable.
So favorable was it that he was placed in charge of the construction
of a river boat at Pittsburg, and in 1811 the <i>New Orleans</i>
made her maiden trip down the Mississippi. Thereafter Roosevelt's
boat took a regular route between New Orleans and Natchez.
Other boats were added, but it was not until 1815 that a voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was made upstream from New Orleans to Louisville and Cincinnati.
After assisting Jackson in the campaign about New Orleans,
the <i>Enterprise</i>, taking advantage of high water, steamed to
Louisville in <em>twenty-five days</em>. In 1817 the <i>Washington</i> accomplished
the same feat while the river was within her banks, and the
public became convinced of the practicability of upstream navigation.
The same year the <i>Shelby</i> reduced the time to twenty days,
and by 1823 <em>fifteen days sufficed</em>. With the success of the steamboat,
the Middle West was opened to rapid communication with
the gulf.</p>


<p class="pfs80">WAGON ROADS INTO THE INTERIOR.</p>

<p>From 1807 to 1815 two changes had a marked effect upon the
national attitude toward internal improvements. Before the outbreak
of the European wars manufactures had made some progress
in New England and in Pennsylvania. During the first struggle, and
before the peace of Amiens, the only serious obstacle to American
industry was the tendency to divert capital to wheat raising, shipbuilding
and foreign trade. Prices were high, and the makers of
goods found encouragement in large profits. With the cessation
of hostilities American manufacturers looked to Congress for protection,
for foreign goods poured into the country in such quantities
and at such prices as to threaten the destruction of domestic production.</p>

<p>At the most, however, the manufacturing population was relatively
small, but the disturbances to industry from 1815 to 1818
were such as to throw many out of employment, and to bring to
the verge of bankruptcy and starvation those who had been engaged
in shipbuilding and foreign trade. A great exodus to the
interior was the result. In wagons, on horseback, or on foot&mdash;sometimes
using handcarts, sleds and wheelbarrows to carry their provisions
and light luggage&mdash;emigrants crowded the wooded paths
that led to the West, where they might find conditions more favorable
to independent livelihood.</p>

<p>All these conditions conspired to increase the depression in the
East, and drive her people into agriculture and the development
of the interior; while the opening of the Mississippi by the steamboat
added to the attractions of the rich valleys in the Middle West.
But upon his arrival in the West the newcomer found himself beyond
the range of any market except New Orleans. To reach this
market he "would produce or get together a quantity of corn, flour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
bacon and such articles. He <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'would built'">would build</ins> a flat-bottomed boat on
the shore of some river or large creek, load his wares into it, and,
awaiting the rise, with a few of his negroes to assist him, would
float down to New Orleans. The voyage was long, tedious and
expensive. When he arrived there he found himself in a strange
city, filled with sharpers ready to take advantage of his necessities.
Everybody combined against him to profit by his ignorance of business,
want of friends or commercial connections, and nine times
out of ten he returned a broken merchant. His journey home was
performed on foot, through three or four nations of Indians
inhabiting the western parts of Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky.
He returned to a desolate farm, which had been neglected
whilst he had been gone. One crop was lost by absence and another
by taking it to market. This kind of business was persevered
in astonishingly for several years, to the great injury and
utter ruin of a great many people." It was the demand for safe
transportation arising out of this situation which made Roosevelt's
steamboat enterprise a success.</p>


<p class="pfs80">DEVELOPMENT OF COASTWISE COMMERCE.</p>

<p>The British blockade of our coast during the war of 1812 had
a marked effect upon the development of inland routes of transportation,
as may be seen from the following: "The interruption
of the coasting trade was indeed a very serious affair. For years
past that trade had given occupation to thousands of coasters and
tens of thousands of sailors. The shoes made at Lynn, the Yankee
notions of Connecticut, the cotton cards, the domestic cottons, the
playing cards produced in New England, the flour of the Middle
States, the East India goods brought in from abroad had found a
ready market at Charleston, Savannah and Augusta, whence great
quantities of rice and cotton were brought North. On the arrival
of the British fleet this trade, no longer to be carried on in safety
by water, began of necessity to be carried on by land. At first
some merchants at Boston, having chartered a few wagons, despatched
them with loads to Philadelphia, and even to Baltimore.
This was enough. The hint was taken. A new industry sprang
up, and by early summer the roads leading southward exhibited one
continuous stream of huge canvas-covered wagons tugged along
by double or triple teams of horses or of oxen. No distance was
then too great, and hundreds of them would make their way from
Salem and Boston to Augusta and Savannah. An estimate made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
towards the close of the year (1814) places the number of wagons
thus employed at four thousand, and the number of cattle, horses
and oxen at twenty thousand; nor does this seem excessive, for a
traveler who drove from New York to Richmond declares that he
passed two hundred and sixty wagons on the way."</p>


<p class="pfs80">THE CAPITALIZATION OF TURNPIKES.</p>

<p>Both overland trade and westward migration drew attention to
the importance of good roads, both swelled the receipts of turnpike
companies, and gave encouragement to investment of local
capital in transportation improvement. By 1804 the Lancaster road
had been extended to Pittsburg, and a regular stage line established
which made a trip each way once a week. State governments lent
every encouragement to the building of turnpike roads, <em>even to the
extent of subscribing to their stock</em>. From contemporary writings
and charter grants, it is estimated that nearly eight hundred turnpike
companies were organized before the end of the war of 1812.
Pennsylvania was pre-eminent in granting liberal charters, and toll
rights, thereby encouraging the people of the more thickly settled
districts to make such improvements for themselves. The corporations
thus formed had little difficulty in obtaining capital subscriptions,
whether for the construction of turnpikes or bridges, or
for the operation of ferries. To the stock of these corporations
several of the states subscribed in varying amounts. Although a
few toll roads were constructed before that time, the turnpike movement
may be said to date from the opening of the nineteenth century.
Turnpikes (so called from the revolving, or turning bar, or
pike which, when set across a toll road, prevented passage until
charges were paid) were macadamized or otherwise improved at a
cost varying from $500 to $10,000 per mile. Almost without exception
they followed in a general way the old lines which had been
worked out when travel on foot or on horseback was the chief
method of communication, but wherever possible they were made
straight, going over and not around hills and other obstacles. When
the Boston and Salem turnpike was built a small but deep pond
was encountered, but instead of going around the road crossed on
a floating bridge. The construction of bridges and the operation
of ferries were parts of this larger turnpike movement, and like the
turnpikes themselves, they were usually disappointing to those who
had invested with the hope of large dividends. At best, this movement
did but little to supply the great need for improved transpor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>tation.
To passenger service it was a great boon, in that it added
much to personal comfort, though the time and cost of travel were
little reduced. <em>It required five dollars and fifty cents to pay tolls
from Philadelphia to New York, besides the hotel bills and other
expenses of the road.</em> It took a week to go from Philadelphia to
Pittsburg. What the country most needed&mdash;a cheap method of
handling the bulky products of the interior&mdash;was not supplied.
Freight was carried upon the turnpike with great difficulty and expense,
and heavy goods were compelled to remain untouched on
account of the high tolls.</p>


<p class="pfs80">REVIVAL OF CANAL CONSTRUCTION.</p>

<p>To meet this situation, canals had been proposed long before
the period of turnpike building, and some surveys had been made,
but because of lack of capital, construction was deferred. The
earliest projects were for short cuts around rapids or falls, or
between neighboring waters, but bolder plans followed. The first
canal of any importance actually begun in the United States was
the two-mile cut through the rocks about the South Hadley falls
of the Connecticut. The Massachusetts legislature passed an act
in 1792 incorporating the "Proprietors of the Locks and Canals on
Connecticut River." Work was begun at once with Dutch capital,
and in two years the canal was completed.</p>

<p>The Santee canal in South Carolina was the first large work of
this kind constructed in the United States. It connected the Santee
river with the Cooper river at Charleston, and it was opened in
1800. Its length was twenty-two miles, and its cost $600,000.</p>

<p>A much more important project was the Middlesex canal in
Massachusetts, a charter for which was obtained in 1793. This
canal extended from the Charles river to the Merrimac, twenty-seven
miles, and was designed to attract to Boston the trade normally
tributary to Portsmouth. Work was begun in 1794, and ten
years later the canal was opened for traffic, though it was not entirely
completed until 1808.</p>

<p>The successful completion of the Erie canal, which became an
assured fact long before its actual accomplishment in 1825, stimulated
similar projects all over the country. The local strife between
trade centers, combined with the local demand for outlet, set a
number of private projects in motion. Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore
and Georgetown were successfully appealed to for support for
transportation routes which would enable them to compete with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
New York for the trade of the West. The Blackstone Canal Company,
chartered by Rhode Island and Massachusetts in 1823, began
the construction of a canal along the Blackstone river to connect
Providence and Worcester, and this route was opened for traffic
in 1828. Another New England project started at about the same
time was for a canal to extend from New Haven northwards to
Northampton, and on up the Connecticut valley into Vermont. Two
companies were chartered for this purpose, the Farmington canal
in Connecticut in 1822 and the Hampshire and Hampden canal in
Massachusetts in 1823. The Farmington canal was completed in
1830; but the work on the Hampshire and Hampden project was
for a time abandoned for want of funds, and the canal was not
cut through to Northampton until 1835. While carrying a large
traffic this canal, like the Blackstone canal, was more beneficial to
the general business of the section traversed than to those who held
its stock. Other private works of this period upon which large
sums were expended were: The Delaware and Raritan canal, connecting
Philadelphia with New York; the James River and Kanawha,
an unfinished canal project in Virginia; and the Chesapeake
and Ohio canal, which was not extended further west than Cumberland.</p>


<p class="pfs80">SCARCITY OF CAPITAL FOR CANALS.</p>

<p>On account of local needs, few canal or navigation companies
had difficulty in obtaining their first subscriptions, but most of them
experienced trouble in collecting assessments and in obtaining additional
subscriptions. This timidity of investors, it now appears,
was not without ground, for few of the private canal companies
were able to bring their construction work to completion, and fewer
still paid any dividends to their stockholders. The Middlesex canal
was profitable until the building of a parallel line of railroad; the
Montague canal, also in Massachusetts, yielded a fair return during
the first twenty years that followed its completion in 1800. The
Delaware and Schuylkill canal may be cited as a third exception.
But it early became evident that public works of the number and
magnitude required could be constructed only at national expense.
As the constitution contains no direct provision for internal improvements,
the subject became a party question.</p>

<p>From the first Congress had appropriated money for lighthouses,
public piers, buoys and other aids to navigation, and about such
action there had been no dispute, for it was agreed that these mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>ters
lay strictly within federal jurisdiction. From the first, also,
Congress had been petitioned for appropriations for internal improvements.
Most of these demands were local in character, and
so were easily disposed of; but when the directors of the Chesapeake
and Delaware canal asked Congress to supply the funds which
they had been unable to obtain from sales of shares, the question
was forced to an issue. Two facts were <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'incontestible'">incontestable</ins>, the general
importance of the work, and the ability of the national government
to carry it on in view of the revenue surplus in the treasury.</p>

<p>In another way Congress had already committed itself to the
support of public works. So long as the country was made up of
states bordering on the Atlantic seaboard, improvements were matters
of interest to all alike, but with the admission of new states
in the interior, and the prospect of future accessions to the westward
as the country expanded, an element of injustice seemed to
enter these appropriations, which benefited the seaboard states
at the expense of all. The feeling of discontent was intensified by
the fact that the favored states were more thickly settled, and
therefore better able to incur the expense. With the admission of
Ohio, however, this was remedied by the establishment of the five
per cent. land fund, and the self-interest of the seaboard was appealed
to by the argument that the building of roads into the West
would so stimulate sales of the public lands as to increase the national
revenues.</p>

<p>The matter of national aid to internal improvements was again
brought before Congress in 1816 by Calhoun, who presented a bill
providing for the direct construction of roads and canals and the
improvement of waterways out of a fund to be created by setting
apart the bonus and dividends received by the government from
the United States bank. This bill, which was drawn up by Clay,
passed through Congress in 1817, but it was vetoed by Madison,
who, though favorably disposed toward public works, had inherited
from Jefferson a doubt as to the rights of Congress to participate
in their construction without a constitutional amendment specifically
granting the authority. And Monroe, holding the same opinion,
vetoed a bill for the repair of the Cumberland road, and submitted
to Congress a long statement of the principles involved in
his decision. In the meantime, weary of waiting, New York had
succeeded in building the Erie canal. Its success shifted the whole
plan of promotion. With credit established abroad, internal im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>provements
were taken up by the states, and for the next two
decades transportation interest centers in state funding.</p>

<p>It was during this period of struggle for means of transportation
facilities adequate to meet the demands of those whose fortunes
had been cast in the remote interior that the railroad became the
subject of serious economic interest.</p>

<p class="right"><em>Philadelphia, June 12, 1848.</em></p>

<p class="negin2">To the President and Directors of the<br />
Pennsylvania Railroad Company:</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>&mdash;I have the honor to communicate to you the following
Report of the operations of this Department since it was
committed to my charge, now something more than a year.</p>

<p>Under the organization of the Engineer Department, as adopted
previous to my acceptance of the office you have conferred upon
me, the Road was to be divided into three divisions, Eastern, Western
and Middle: Edward Miller, Esq., as associate engineer, was
assigned to the Western, and W. B. Foster, Jr., to the Eastern
division. These gentlemen had entered upon the survey of their
respective lines, previous to my arrival, under instructions from
the president, each with two full corps of assistants. The middle,
or mountain division, not having been provided for, I concluded
after a full consideration of the subject that the interest of the
Company would be best promoted by so altering the organization
as to abolish it altogether, and extend the eastern and western divisions
to the summit of the Allegheny mountains, the natural
boundary between them. Under this arrangement, the surveys
have since been prosecuted.</p>

<p>The Board having directed me to cause a location of the whole
line, from Harrisburg to Pittsburg, to be made at the earliest
practicable period, I at once commenced a reconnoissance of that
portion of the intervening country, over which it seemed&mdash;from an
inspection of a map of the State&mdash;that the Road would probably
pass, for the purpose of determining the best plan of operations
to carry out their views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The Legislature, in their grant to the Company, wisely left the
choice of a route for the Road, between its termini, entirely free,
throwing upon the Board the responsibility of selecting, upon the
wide field that was opened to them, a line for their great work,
which would offer the cheapest railroad conveyance for the transportation
of freight and the most expeditious for travel that could
be selected between the west and the northern Atlantic cities.</p>

<p>Such a route, it was believed from previous surveys, lay within
the borders of Pennsylvania, an expectation which has been fully
justified by the results obtained from our examinations.</p>

<p>Of the several routes proposed, I found no difficulty&mdash;after a
careful inspection of the plans of the various surveys, made under
the authority of the Commonwealth, and my reconnoissance of
the country&mdash;in coming to the conclusion that the valley of the
Juniata offered advantages for a line which, whether we consider
the low gradients that may be obtained along it or its general directness,
the desiderata required, is without a rival.</p>

<p>This stream has its source in the Alleghenies, and consequently
severs, as it flows towards the Atlantic, all the secondary mountain
ranges that lie east of them, and it heads opposite to the Black
Lick and Conemaugh rivers, both of which sever those on the
west, leaving the main Allegheny only to be surmounted, which
would have to be encountered upon any other <em>direct</em> route, in
addition to many of the inferior mountain ranges. A more northern
route, by the west branch of the Susquehanna (which has its
source beyond the Allegheny mountains), would have encountered
less elevation at the principal summit, but its great increased length
precluded its adoption; while, on the other hand, a southern route,
though not indirect, was equally objectionable on account of the
rugged character of the country, and the high gradients necessary
to overcome the numerous summits upon it. A partial examination
of one of the proposed southern routes was made, which followed
the Cumberland Valley Railroad to near Shippensburg, and
thence, crossing to the west side of the valley at Roxbury, it passed
through the Blue Mountain, by a long tunnel, into Path valley;
thence, following around the point of Dividing mountain, it crossed
this valley and passed through Tuscarora, by another tunnel, to
the valley of Augwick creek. Thence it would have been traced
between Broad Top and Sideling mountains, and up Dunning and
Bob's creeks to the summit of the Alleghenies at Bob's Creek gap;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
or, turning west by Bedford, crossed the Alleghenies at the head
waters of the tributaries of Castleman's river, where the mountain
is still much more elevated.</p>

<p>A line leaving the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Chambersburg,
and turning the end of Blue mountain, thence seeking the
low depression at Cowan's gap in Tuscarora, would be too circuitous
to compare favorably with the bolder line from Shippensburg, already
described.</p>

<p>But that line would encounter engineering difficulties of the most
formidable character; leaving out of view its objectionable gradients,
and considering it in reference to its cost, and the local accommodations
it would extend to a large portion of the State&mdash;at
present in a great measure deprived of the advantages of the State
improvements&mdash;(the strongest argument in favor of the route), it
will be found that equal accommodations could be extended to
that region with a <em>less</em> expenditure of <em>capital</em> by placing the main
stem of the road on the Juniata, and running a branch along one
of the comparatively level valleys that lie between most of the
parallel mountain ranges that we pass.</p>

<p>The facilities that railroads offer for extending their benefits to
remote districts by means of lateral lines constitute one of their
chief advantages over canals, and should prevent the error, too
frequently committed in locating leading routes, of turning from a
direct course to accommodate local interests to the injury of the
great object intended to be accomplished.</p>

<p>Other modifications of the Juniata route have been suggested, and
their merits fully considered, but, upon examination, all of them
tended to confirm our preference in favor of the river line.</p>

<p>These conclusions were communicated to the Board, and the
general route recommended having been adopted by them, I proceeded
at once to make arrangements to have the line surveyed
throughout. For this purpose three additional corps of engineers
were organized&mdash;one for Mr. Miller's division, under the immediate
direction of Mr. G. W. Leuffer, to operate on the summit
and western slope of the mountain, and two upon Mr. Foster's,
the first of which was placed in charge of Edward Tilghman, Esq.,
to whom was assigned the district between Lewistown and the confluence
of the Raystown branch and main Juniata rivers.</p>

<p>The other corps was given in charge to S. W. Mifflin, Esq., a
gentleman of well-known professional skill and experience, to whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
we committed the surveys of the region from the Raystown branch
to the summit of the Alleghenies, embracing the most important
and difficult district upon the whole route to Pittsburg.</p>

<p>These parties did not take the field until the close of July, but
they prosecuted their examinations with so much energy and
success that we were enabled to determine the general line of the
eastern division in season to place the most difficult points upon
it under contract in November of last year.</p>

<p>While these arrangements were in progress, the parties previously
in the field were actively engaged in examining the country
between Harrisburg and Lewistown.</p>

<p>At the instance of a number of gentlemen from Perry county,
a line was tried up Little Juniata creek, leaving the Susquehanna
at Petersburg, thence near Bloomfield and along Sherman's valley
to Concord gap, where it passed the Tuscarora mountain, thence
it followed Tuscarora valley to Shade creek, and down that stream
to Augwick creek, along the valley of which it was carried to
Drake's ferry on the Juniata. The advantage promised for this
route was a considerable saving of distance. The result, however,
demonstrated that not only would we have had to encounter gradients
running up as high as sixty feet per mile, but the length of
the line would be increased four miles by its adoption. It was
consequently abandoned.</p>

<p>After a careful examination of the country bordering on the
Susquehanna and Juniata rivers, a line has been located as far up
as Huntingdon, which is believed to be the best that can be obtained.</p>

<p>If the valleys of these streams had not been preoccupied by other
improvements, a route would have been selected differing somewhat
in its details from that adopted. Even for the short distance
that we are brought into close proximity with them, the cost of the
grading of the Road has been greatly enhanced by the confined
ground we have been forced upon.</p>

<p>The located line commences at the Harrisburg and Lancaster
Railroad depot; thence, passing through Harrisburg, it follows the
sloping ground between the canal and the capitol ridge four miles,
when it crosses the canal and, touching the point of Blue mountain,
recrosses and passes to the west side of the Susquehanna
river by a bridge 3,660 feet in length, and 44 feet above low water
at grade line, which enables us to place the road on the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
bridge. Thence we pursue this bank of the river through the villages
of Duncannon and Petersburg to the Juniata, along the southern
side of which it is continued through Newport and Perrysville
to a point a short distance above Lewistown. Here the line crosses
to the north side of the river, and within a short distance recrosses,
to save nearly a mile of road, and one hundred and eighty degrees
of curvature, together with some difficult ground along the bluff
shores on the south side of the stream.</p>

<p>After regaining the southern side we follow the river slopes,
over favorable ground, to Mr. Harvey's, about seven miles above
Waynesburg, where the line again crosses to the north side, and
passing back of Newton Hamilton, cuts through the neck of land
in the great bend of that stream, 40 feet in depth at the summit
and 3,100 feet in length at grade. Descending along the eastern
slope of the river, we once more cross it at Shaeffer's aqueduct, and
continue upon its southwestern bank through Jack's narrows, without
meeting any serious difficulties, and finally pass to its north side,
along which it is continued through Huntingdon to the Little Juniata,
above Petersburg. Above Huntingdon, a preliminary location
has been carried up the Little Juniata to Logan's narrows, at which
point this stream divides Bald Eagle and Brush mountains in its
passage from Tuckahoe valley.</p>

<p>Along the Little Juniata, from Dorsey's forge to the Narrows,
the line encounters much difficult ground, owing to the circuitous
character of the stream, and the high hills and mountains which
bound its course. To obtain a route with easy curves we are
forced, within this distance, to tunnel the point of Tussey's mountain,
and to cross the river twelve times. To follow the line recommended
by Mr. Schlatter through this region curves of 400 feet
radius would have had to be resorted to, which I deem wholly inadmissible
upon a road of the importance of that you have in view.</p>

<p>At Logan's Narrows we reach the valley that skirts the whole
eastern base of the Allegheny mountains. Here it becomes necessary
to determine the plan to be adopted to overcome the great barrier
that separates us from the West. If it is to be surmounted by
a road, with the gradients of the western division, the ascent must
commence at this point, and gradually wind its way to the summit,
by an almost continuous gradient, along the declivities of the
mountains for nearly thirty-two miles, crossing the several streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that issue from it, by high bridges, and cutting through or tunneling
their dividing summits.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlatter, in his Report to the Canal Commissioners, estimates
the cost of grading the road, on this ascent, at $1,496,146,
which I consider too low for a line with the gradient he adopted,
but with the increased maximum grade found necessary on the
western division, and a somewhat lengthened line, it would probably
prove sufficient.</p>

<p>Upon my first reconnoissance of this portion of the country it
occurred to me that its peculiar topographical features were lost
sight of in the adoption of this plan of ascent, which seemed to
look to the single object of obtaining a line with a particular
gradient, without regard to the magnitude of the obstacles to be
overcome to procure it; while, by pursuing a course from the Narrows,
nearly in a direct line to Sugar Run gap (which we shall
hereafter show is the best point to cross the mountain), the line
would pass through a beautiful valley over comparatively favorable
ground, gradually gaining elevation through its whole course, without
exceeding the maximum inclination required on the line below,
until it reaches the summit of the valley at Robinson's, a
distance of fifteen miles. At this point we attain an elevation of
1,174 feet above tide, leaving but 980 feet to be overcome to reach
the height found most suitable for passing the mountain, which
is attained by a continuous gradient of 80 feet per mile, encountering
no <em>very</em> formidable difficulties.</p>

<p>A resort to a gradient of 80 or more feet per mile is by no means
an unusual expedient on leading railroads.</p>

<p>Upon the Western Railroad, in Massachusetts, their maximum
gradient is 83½ feet per mile. On the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad
they now have, between the waters of the Patapsco and Potomac,
on each side of Parr's ridge, gradients of 82 feet per mile, and
from the greater elevation of the Allegheny mountains at the place
they must cross, it is to be presumed that their gradients at that
point will still be increased to a higher rate.</p>

<p>Many other instances might be cited, some running up to 120
feet per mile, but it seems unnecessary to extend the list. Theoretically,
the power necessary to overcome a given height is the
same at all inclinations of the plane of ascent, but in practice, it is
to some extent dependent upon the kind of power to be applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>In the case under consideration, the locomotive steam engine
will be the medium used, where the power is carried with the train,
and forms part of the load to be moved, consequently, the cost
of power on a plane ascending 80 feet per mile is greater than upon
one of a more moderate inclination of equal height, by the difference
between the gravity of the engines required to carry the same
load on both planes.</p>

<p>As a general principle this would be true when the lengths of
the roads to overcome the same height are equal, and it is necessary
to carry the locomotives, required for the high gradient, over
the same distance that they must run upon the low gradient.</p>

<p>But in one of these cases the maximum gradient due to the line
below Logan's Narrows is carried to within 12¼ miles of the summit
of the mountain&mdash;requiring extra power for that distance only&mdash;and
in the other it ends 32 miles from it.</p>

<p>To explain more fully the relative value of the maximum
gradients used on the different divisions of our Road, I have prepared
the following table:</p>

<p>It will be perceived from the foregoing table that three locomotives
are fully sufficient to transport the same load up the 80 feet
gradient that two will carry on the gradient of the western division,
and one on the eastern; hence the practical working of the road
on the two methods of ascent would be to run two locomotives with
the load brought from below from Logan's Narrows to the summit,
say 31¾ miles, up the 50 feet gradient; while, on the other,
the same engine that brought the load from Harrisburg would continue
with it to Robinson's (15 miles), where it would accompany
the two destined for Pittsburg to the summit of the mountain and
return.</p>

<p>In the first case the engines together will have traveled 63½
miles, and, in the other, the three 51¾, leaving a difference in distance
to be traveled by the moving power due to each full train,
from the east, 11¾ miles in favor of the 80 feet gradient.</p>

<p>In practice it will therefore be seen&mdash;chiefly on account of the
actual distance saved&mdash;that transportation can be afforded cheaper,
in this case, on the 80 feet gradient than on the 50, without bringing
into the estimate the interest on $841,000 that the latter would
cost to obtain it more than the former. Under these circumstances
we did not hesitate when the choice of routes was reduced to a selection
between these two methods of overcoming the mountain,
to decide in favor of the line by Robinson's, which has the additional
advantage of bringing us within 6-1/3 miles of Hollidaysburg,
where a connection may be made with the Allegheny Portage by a
branch line, passing over favorable ground.</p>

<p>The distance from Harrisburg to Robinson's summit is 132-2/3
miles; upon the whole of this line, the only extraordinary impediments
to the easy graduation of the road bed are the bridge over
the Susquehanna, a deep and long cut near Newton Hamilton, and
a tunnel 1,200 feet in length through a point of Tussey's mountain,
and in this distance the maximum ascending gradient to Lewistown
is 16 feet per mile, and descending 8 feet. Thence, to Robinson's
summit, they are increased to 21 feet ascending, and 10-1/8
feet descending.</p>

<p>The descending gradients are generally so short that they will
not be found, in practice, to decrease the load going east much
below what is due to a fair <em>working</em> load for a locomotive on a
level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The maximum ascending gradient above Lewistown is determined
by the deep cut near Newton Hamilton. The ascent of the Little
Juniata seems, however, to require&mdash;to obtain an economical line&mdash;the
use of this inclination, without much intermission, from
Dorsey's forge to Robinson's summit. Below Lewistown the
gradients are fixed to accommodate the increased trade that would
fall upon the line between that place and Harrisburg, without increasing
the number of trains.</p>

<p>These low gradients insure to us the important advantages of
a single pair of drivers for the passenger engines, upon the eastern
division, and, with these rates of inclination, we are enabled to
make the line conform to the natural features of the country (above
high water mark) without decreasing the curvature below 955 feet
radius, except at the east end of the Susquehanna bridge, where
a radius of 880 feet has been admitted.</p>

<p>All of our efforts to save distance, by deviating, temporarily,
from the immediate valley of the river, involved either the use of
high gradients, not justified by the distance saved, or an increased
cost that was equally unwarranted. The beautiful valley of the
Kishacoquillas offered the greatest temptation to leave the river
route; but here we would have had to encounter gradients, in both
directions, of 26-4/10 feet per mile, a bridge over Mill creek, 1,200
feet long, 111 high; another over a small tributary of the Juniata,
850 feet long and 150 feet in height, together with several others,
or embankments of great magnitude, across ravines in the north
slope of the river hills. These difficulties, added to 342 feet of
additional elevation to be surmounted at the Allentown summit,
so greatly overbalanced the small increase of curvature and distance
(7/10 of a mile), by the river route, that it could not be
adopted. It was also ascertained that by the <em>use of the maximum
gradients</em> required on the valley route, the shortest line could have
been procured by the river, and at the least cost. A fact, conclusive
in itself, as to the proper route.</p>

<p>I deemed it unnecessary to make further instrumental examinations
of the Stone mountain route, feeling satisfied that even if a
line could be obtained in that direction which would approximate
to an equality, in an engineering point of view, with the route selected&mdash;which,
from a reconnoissance of a portion of the line and
an examination of the plots of Mr. Schlatter's surveys, I should consider
<em>quite</em> improbable&mdash;that its additional cost would entrench so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
much upon the means of the Company as to place it entirely out
of the question.</p>

<p>A line was traced from Huntingdon to the Frankstown branch
of the Juniata, below Williamsburg, across Tussey's mountain, by
which a saving of distance could have been made nearly equal to
the Stone mountain route, but its high gradients, cost, and the
length of time that it would require to build the road over it rendered
it equally objectionable. The valley of the Frankstown
branch was also surveyed; the route by it joining the Little Juniata
line at Robinson's ridge, but it proved both longer and more expensive
than the latter. The searching examinations made of the
whole region offering any chance for a more practicable route, on
the north or south of the Juniata, leaves no doubt upon my mind
but that the best line has been procured for the eastern division.
Its comparatively easy curvature and low gradients, adapted in
their inclination to the direction of the largest business, and extending
from the eastern terminus of our Road to the foot of the
great barrier that divides us from the west, give it advantages that
are not equaled by any other route proposed, between the east and
west, and can not be too highly appreciated by the Company.</p>

<p>Before determining the point to pass the mountain, a full examination
of its crest was made, from Cedar Swamp summit on
the south, to Three Springs Gap at the head of Moshannon creek
on the north, embracing a distance of 44 miles. The following
table will show the elevation, above tide, of each summit within
that distance; also, that at Emigh's Gap, on the northern route,
and at the head waters of Castleman's river on the southern:</p>

<p>It will be perceived that the lowest point in the mountain, except
at Emigh's, is Maple Gap, from which issues Bell's Run (a
branch of the Little Juniata), on the east, and Sandy Run of
Clearfield, on the west. This point is 61 feet below Sugar Run
Gap and could be further reduced 150 feet by a tunnel 700 yards
in length. If the ground had been favorable beyond the summit,
this route would probably have offered the greatest advantages to
cross the mountain, but it opens westwardly upon the deep valley
of Clearfield, a descent into which would involve the necessity of
a resort to as steep a gradient on the west side of the mountain as
that required on the east; and the elevation thus lost would have
to be regained by following up the valley to Laurel Swamp or
Munster summits, in the ridge that separates Clearfield from the
Conemaugh, which is here the true backbone of the country.</p>

<p>Any attempt to carry a line along the west slope of the mountain,
to avoid the descent to Clearfield, would, from the rugged character
of the ground, prove impracticable, without a vast increase
in its cost, length and curvature. No other point offers equal advantages
to cross the mountain until we reach Sugar Run Gap, which
is 41 feet below the Portage Railroad summit, and may be reduced
120 feet more by a tunnel 2,000 feet in length. Emigh's Gap, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
is still lower than Maple Gap, could not, on account of its gradual
slope, be reduced by a tunnel of moderate cost, and it is also too
far north for a direct route to Pittsburg. South of the Portage
the Alleghenies become the watershed of the Union, dividing the
streams that flow into the gulf from those that empty into the Atlantic.
They here assume a more elevated character than while separating
only the tributaries of the Susquehanna, affording no opportunity
to pass them by a line adapted to locomotive power&mdash;unless
by a tunnel of immense extent&mdash;until we reach Bob's Creek
Gap. The accompanying profile, which exhibits the crest line of
the mountain (for 44 miles) will give a more definite idea of the
relative height of these summits.</p>

<p>The mountain on each side of Bob's Creek Gap rises to a considerable
height, making it appear, to a casual observer, a very deep
depression; and, from this circumstance, it has generally been considered
by the residents of the adjoining country to be the lowest
pass in the Alleghenies, and, as it falls off rapidly on either side,
it has also been supposed that it could be farther reduced by a
tunnel of moderate extent. The several surveys of the mountain,
however, prove it to be 212 feet higher than Sugar Run Gap,
and, to reduce it to a level with the surface of the ground at the
latter point, which is 120 feet above the grade of the adopted line,
it would require a tunnel 1¼ miles in length, to be constructed under
very disadvantageous local circumstances.</p>

<p>Cedar Swamp Gap, still farther south, is 53 feet lower than Bob's
Creek Gap, but it falls off on each side so gradually that it could
not be reduced conveniently more than 40 feet.</p>

<p>Neither of these points, therefore, which are the only passes
worthy of notice south of the Portage Railroad that lie within the
region over which a direct line to Pittsburg must necessarily traverse,
afford depressions that will compare favorably with those
farther north; nor does the ground leading to them, east or west
of the mountains, offer equal facilities to obtain a line of uniform
ascent to the summit. The distance from the Conemaugh is too
short to overcome the elevation with the gradient used on the
western division, and, from the Juniata, the greater height to be
ascended would continue the line so long upon the mountain steeps
that it would be exceedingly expensive to procure a roadbed with
a gradient even higher than 80 feet per mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>From the foregoing description of the most favorable mountain
passes, it will be seen that Sugar Run Gap offers the greatest facilities
to cross the Allegheny.</p>

<p>It now becomes necessary to consider in what direction the Road
can be carried thence to Pittsburg. From an inspection of a map of
the State it will be seen that a straight line, drawn from this gap
to Pittsburg, will fall on Munster, Beulah, and follow the valley
of Black Lick for nearly its whole extent, and intersect the Conemaugh
near Blairsville; thence it crosses the country lying within
the elbow formed by the Kiskeminetas and Allegheny rivers, passing
the Loyalhanna and Crabtree waters, and following, generally, the
high and broken ridge parting the Allegheny and Monongahela
rivers. That line, which would approximate most nearly to this
course, would&mdash;all other things being equal&mdash;be the most desirable
for the Road.</p>

<p>The operations of the different corps, on this division, have
been confined to surveys that were necessary to determine the
point of crossing the mountain and to the regions between the
Conemaugh and Pittsburg, west of the Chestnut ridge. Our examinations
have not yet been sufficiently extensive to enable me
to give a full description of that part of the country between the
mountain and Blairsville, and I shall therefore leave it for a future
report, with the simple remark that, from the information before
me, I am satisfied that a practicable line may be obtained by
the valleys, either of the Black Lick or Conemaugh, within the
maximum gradient used upon the western division.</p>

<p>The district of country over which it will be necessary to carry
the road from the Conemaugh to Pittsburg is one of remarkable
intricacy. It lies wholly within the coal measures, and has, at some
period, evidently been nearly a level plane of vast extent, covered
by the ocean. The discharge of the waters from this wide spread
field seems to have been sudden, forming numerous circuitous channels
in every direction, cutting deeply into the soft horizontal strata
of this region, in their descent to the tributaries of the Ohio, leaving
the intervening ridges washed into so uneven a surface as to
render the passage of a railroad along them entirely out of the question.
A line following the Conemaugh&mdash;which bears northwest
from Blairsville&mdash;to the Allegheny would avoid this difficult country,
but the length of the route would be increased fully 50 per cent.,
and it is, therefore, inadmissible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>A route with higher gradients than those adopted on the Juniata
throughout this division seems to be called for by the topography
of the country.</p>

<p>In his report upon the western division, Mr. Miller gives the
following account of the surveys, conducted under his direction
by Messrs. Day and Pemberton, his principal assistants: "If a
straight line be drawn from Blairsville to Pittsburg, it will be seen
that Turtle creek is the only stream that approximates to the
proper course of the road, whilst the Loyalhanna, the chief tributary
of the Conemaugh, crosses it nearly at right angles, and Spruce
Run, Roaring Run, Porter's Run, Beaver Run and others intersect
it at various angles of obliquity. Much time and labor were
bestowed by Mr. Schlatter and his principal assistant, Mr. Roebling,
upon the investigation of this district, and their maps and profiles,
loaned to us by the Canal Commissioners, have been of much
service in our examinations. From a careful investigation of Mr.
Schlatter's preferred route on the ground, it appeared possible
to avoid some of the most formidable obstacles which he encountered
by adopting a higher gradient than his maximum of
45 feet per mile, and by a reasonable increase of distance at a few
points.</p>

<p>"Our trial lines confirmed this, and, in the location made, a
maximum of 1. in 100, or 52-8/10 feet per mile, has been used at
several places. The cheapness of fuel throughout the whole extent
of the western division renders this increase of gradient less
objectionable than elsewhere. Bituminous coal, of the best quality,
is everywhere abundant, and can be delivered at the depots at from
56 to 84 cents per ton."</p>

<p>The principal changes made in the route referred to in Mr.
Schlatter's report Mr. Miller describes as follows:</p>

<p>"Upon the White Thorn our line keeps the left bank, entirely
to its mouth, avoiding a tunnel of 600 feet, leading into the valley
of Buck Run, and a high bridge over White Thorn creek, and reducing
that over the Loyalhanna, from 90 to 50 feet in height.
West of Buchanan's summit we run level round the hill, between
Porter's Run and Beaver Run, avoiding the Still House summit
entirely, where a tunnel of 1,000 feet was proposed, with a cut
of 70 feet at its western end, running out to grade in a distance
of 1,700 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Passing Burnt Cabin summit, by a deep cut, the line descends
along Turtle creek to the Monongahela.</p>

<p>"Below Murraysville the creek makes a double bend, like the
letter S. The former line crossed one of these bends, by a tunnel
600 feet long, whilst ours crosses the other by a short, deep cut, following
a remarkable pass by which the hill is nearly cut through.
These changes have reduced many of the deep cuts, avoided several
bridges, saved three tunnels, and reduced the length of a fourth,
amounting in all to a reduction of 2,300 feet of tunneling."</p>

<p>After reaching the Monongahela, two routes present themselves,
one following the bank of the stream to Pittsburg, and the other
ascending along the slope of the river hills, enters a valley leading
by Wilkinsburg and East Liberty. Thence, following this valley,
it descends Two Mile Run, and enters the city on the Allegheny
side. The latter, though the longest route, and requiring gradients
of 50 feet per mile, has been adopted as it presented the only apparently
feasible route by which a connection could be formed
with a road extending towards the great west.</p>

<p>The comparative cost of grading and damages, upon the two
lines, would be rather in favor of the route adopted.</p>

<p>A line has also been located from the junction of Turtle and
Bush creeks, which passes up Bush creek and through Greensburg
to Bernhard's summit, thence by the valleys of Fourteen Mile Run,
Sauxman's and Magee's Runs, to the Conemaugh, at the gap
through Chestnut ridge.</p>

<p>If the Conemaugh route, by Johnstown, should be adopted, the
line by Greensburg will be about 3¾ miles longer than that by
Turtle creek, but passes east of the Loyalhanna, over much more
favorable ground than any other line examined.</p>

<p>Its advantages, in relation to the local trade of a rich and
populous section of country, west and east of Chestnut ridge,
through the gap formed by the Loyalhanna, give it strong claim for
consideration.</p>

<p>Whether the increased length of the line and the difficulties west
of Greensburg will be sufficient to counterbalance these local advantages
we will leave undecided until the comparative estimates
have been fully made out. Another line was traced, leaving Greensburg
and passing into Ligonier valley, through Chestnut ridge, at
the Loyalhanna Gap, thence north of this ridge along Coalpit and
Kendrick's Runs, to the Conemaugh, which resulted unfavorably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Further examinations will be made through Ligonier valley,
striking the Conemaugh higher up. The Black Lick and the country
between it and the Conemaugh will also be examined during
the season.</p>

<p>The following summary statement will exhibit the estimated
cost and distances of a continuous railroad from Harrisburg to
Pittsburg, via Johnstown and Blairsville, graded for a double track,
and a single track and turnouts laid.</p>

<p>The estimate is based on prices that are believed to be ample
to finish the road in a substantial manner. If the work should be
pushed with <em>cautious energy</em>, it may be completed for a somewhat
less sum.</p>

<p>The width of the roadbed at grade line in thorough cuts of earth
is 32 feet, in rock 26 feet and on embankments 25 feet.</p>

<p>That part of the line below Huntingdon has been located permanently;
thence to Logan's Narrows the calculations are based
on a preliminary location, and between this point and Blairsville
upon an experimental survey, with liberal allowances for contingencies.
Between Blairsville and Pittsburg the road has been
carefully located. Upon that portion of it, between Blairsville and
Turtle creek, gradients of 52-8/10 feet per mile have been admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
which may be reduced to 50 feet per mile, by the expenditure of an
additional sum of $40,000.</p>

<p>Our measurements of distances commence at the depot of the
Harrisburg and Lancaster Railroad Company, 106¾ miles from the
corner of Vine and Broad streets, in the city of Philadelphia, and
terminate at the intersection of Liberty street, in the city of Pittsburg.
Those made for the Commonwealth, under the direction of
Mr. Schlatter, began at State street, in Harrisburg, and ended at
Two Mile Run, on the Monongahela river, giving a difference in
favor of Mr. Schlatter's line of about 1-8/10 miles in the points of
starting. Between Blairsville and Pittsburg our distance has been
actually increased 2-8/10 miles over that proposed by Mr. S., after
making allowance for about 6/10 of a mile of an unaccountable
discrepancy in the two measurements. This increased distance is
incurred to save three tunnels, and other expensive work, amounting,
together, to $280,000, or $100,000 per mile.</p>

<p>The whole difference between Mr. Schlatter's and Mr. Miller's
measurements, supposing the points of starting and ending to have
been the same, is 4-3/10 miles. The difference between the points
of starting of the two surveys, on Mr. Foster's division, is about
2/10 of a mile. From Harrisburg to Huntingdon we lose, by following
the river route. 7/10 of a mile<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> on Mr. Schlatter's line,
and save, from thence to the summit of the mountain, about four
miles.</p>

<p>As a connection with the Allegheny Portage Railroad would insure
to us most of the advantages of an independent road to the
western base of the mountain, it is evidently the policy of the Company
to make it at the earliest practicable moment. Our location
falling within 6-1/3 miles of that road, it becomes a very small
matter to effect a junction with it. If the present means of the
Company, however, would justify the expenditure, the connection
could readily be made at the foot of Plane No. 4, on the west
side of the mountain, thus saving 7 out of 10 of the inclined
planes. This could be effected for the additional sum of $1,250,000,
or for $950,000 a junction might be made at the summit of the
Portage, avoiding the five eastern planes.</p>

<p>The branch to, or above, Hollidaysburg is, however, the cheapest
and most speedy way of effecting the connection, and when our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>road is carried over the mountain it will remain a good feeder to
the main line, and a fair investment of the capital of the Company.</p>

<p>The following is an estimate of the cost of a continuous road from
Harrisburg to Pittsburg, in connection with the Allegheny Portage
Railroad, graded for a double track throughout, except the branch
to Hollidaysburg:</p>

<p>Making the whole cost of the Road, graded for a double and
a single track laid, including outfit, $8,960,000.00.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to expend the whole of this amount until
some time after the Road is in use to Pittsburg. As the business
increases the turnouts must be lengthened, depots and shops enlarged,
and the number of locomotives and cars added to. These
will not reach the sum estimated until probably four years after
the Road is completed, in connection with the Allegheny Portage.
We shall also reduce the cuttings and embankments to a single
track width, wherever the character of the excavations or a deficiency
of material for embankment will justify the curtailment.
This will effect a saving, in the first outlay, of about $450,000,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which will not be required until the business demands a double
track.</p>

<p>The expenditure for the outfit, when the Road is opened through,
will not exceed $1,340,000, leaving $650,000 of the estimate for
this item to be disbursed after the Road is finished, to meet the demands
of the increased business for the <em>time</em> stated.</p>

<p>The Board having wisely determined in no event to enter into
engagements beyond their ascertained means, I have thought it
best, thus early, to present an estimate of the cost of the whole work
for their guidance. It will be recollected that the estimate for the
grading is made, in part, upon experimental surveys, with full allowances
for contingencies. By the close of the year we hope to
be able to give an estimate of the whole Road, in detail, from actual
location, which may show a somewhat reduced cost.</p>

<p>Under the contemplated connection with that road, the Allegheny
Portage becomes an important part of our line, and, for the information
of the Board, I insert the following description of it,
extracted from a pamphlet written by S. W. Roberts, Civil Engineer:</p>

<p>"The Portage Railroad consists of eleven levels, or graded lines,
and ten inclined planes. The ascent from Johnstown to the summit
is 1,171.58 feet, in a distance of 26.59 miles, and the descent,
from the summit to Hollidaysburg, is 1,398.71 feet in a distance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
10-1/10 miles. There are five inclined planes on each side of the
mountain, varying, in inclination, from 4° 9´ to 5° 51´, or from
7.25 feet to 10.25 feet elevation to each 100 feet base. They are
numbered eastwardly, the one nearest Johnstown being No. 1; that
nearest Hollidaysburg, No. 10. The following table shows the length,
rise and fall of each 'Level' or grade line, and each inclined plane."</p>

<p>In conformity with resolutions of the Board, eighteen miles of
the grading on the eastern and fifteen on the western ends of the
Road were placed under contract in July last. In November the contracts
upon the eastern division were extended to Lewistown, and
on the 17th ult., to Huntingdon, together with a few miles of
heavy work along the Little Juniata, embracing altogether 106 miles.</p>

<p>Very little of the grading, on the western division, has been executed,
as there appeared to be no sufficient reason for pressing that
portion of the Road until the means of the Company would justify
a larger expenditure upon it than they have heretofore.</p>

<p>The work upon the eastern division has been retarded from the
scarcity of labor. Time seems to be required to collect the necessary
force upon the line. With the exception, however, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Susquehanna bridge, the grading will be prepared for the superstructure,
to Lewistown, this year. The masonry of that important
job was first allotted to contractors. The principal of the firm,
though highly recommended by the officers of the Reading Railroad,
proved unequal to the task he had undertaken, and their
contract was abandoned. In consequence, the remnant of last
season, after the contract was let, was mostly lost.</p>

<p>The work has been re-let to Holman, Simons and Burke, who
have carried it forward satisfactorily. The prevalence of high
water, since the season for laying masonry commenced, has prevented
as much progress, at this time, as could have been desired;
but we still entertain hopes that it will be completed before the
ensuing winter. If this is accomplished, the Road can be opened
to Lewistown next spring. Under any ordinary circumstances
it will be finished to Huntingdon (98½ miles) by the close of
navigation in 1849&mdash;a point as low down as we may anticipate a
profitable use of the Road from.</p>

<p>Our arrangements have been made with a view to the completion
of the Road to the Allegheny Portage, early in the spring
of 1850. An earlier period could not be fixed, owing to the magnitude
of some of the work on the Little Juniata; a portion of which,
embracing the tunnel, through a point of Tussey's mountain, was
located and contracted for last December, to avoid delay and a premature
expenditure of capital on the lighter work, which would
have followed a general letting of the whole Road at that time, or
since, even if it could have been prepared for contract in season.</p>

<p>If sufficient means shall be obtained to prosecute the western
division, I would recommend that the heavy portions of the work,
between the Conemaugh and the confluence of Brush and Turtle
creeks, should be placed under contract, together with the grading,
continuously from the Portage road to the point of divergence of
the line from that river towards Pittsburg, if the Conemaugh route
is adopted.</p>

<p>When the connection is made with the Portage Railroad, from
the east, there will then be a continuous railroad from Philadelphia
to Johnstown, 282 miles in length, and, if opened at the same time
to near Blairsville, it will be extended to 310 miles, with only 43
miles of turnpike thence to Pittsburg, or 75 miles of canal navigation,
giving a line of communication, with the Ohio river, far superior
to any railroad route existing, or any that will at that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
be built. On freight destined to the interior of Ohio but one <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'transhipment'">transshipment</ins>
will then be necessary. The canal boats, loaded at the
terminus of the Road, can be conveyed to any point upon the
Ohio canal.</p>

<p>If your Road possesses no other source of revenue than the local
travel and transportation of the rich and populous region to be
traversed by it&mdash;secured, as it will be, from competing lines by
<em>natural barriers</em> stretching out on either side from the Susquehanna
to the Potomac&mdash;they would be sufficient to justify its construction.
The influence of the Pennsylvania canal has called into activity
all the elements necessary to render the enterprise profitable,
and, in consequence, it will be more successful with that improvement,
as a pioneer rival, than if it was now to enter upon an unoccupied
field. Whatever may be the effect of your work upon the
business of the canal&mdash;and I do not believe it will be injurious&mdash;there
can be no doubt but that it will add very materially to the
revenues of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>Important as the local sources of revenue are to the Company,
they will afford but a limited amount of business compared with
that to be derived from the great West. The route of your improvement
is directly on the line that would be most desirable for
a railroad to pass from St. Louis, or the confluence of the Mississippi
and Missouri rivers, through the center of the wealth and enterprise
of the Mississippi valley to the Atlantic. With a map of
the Union before you, it will be found to be impossible to draw a
line upon it that would accommodate so large an amount of population,
or an equal extent of fertile country.</p>

<p>Through the broad bed of mountains that divide the Atlantic
from the Western States&mdash;traversed by our route for 190 miles&mdash;natural
gorges are found, cutting all of them to their bases, except
the Allegheny, which is passed with comparatively easy gradients,
and without encountering difficulties of a very unusual character.
These favorable features of the country give to us a line which is
the shortest and best that can be obtained between these sections
of the Union, and insures to the Company the whole of the travel
and light transportation, with much of the heavy trade, destined
to Philadelphia and points north of this city, of the vast region
between a line along the southern shores of Lake Erie, touching
Lake Michigan, and extending to the far West, and the immediate
valley of the Ohio river. The distance from Cleveland to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
York being 80 miles shorter by this route than by the New York
and Erie Railroad, much of the travel embarked upon the lakes
for that city from the north and west must also be diverted to this
line.</p>

<p>In view of these circumstances, can a reasonable doubt be entertained
by any one as to the profitableness of the stock of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company? Its natural position must give
to it more than sufficient business to make it yield large profits.
Indeed, I confidently advance the opinion that when the Road shall
have been completed that it will not be a question "whether it will
pay an interest on its cost," <em>but to what point the rates of freight
and passage shall be reduced to give the Company ample revenues
and at the same time make the work most extensively useful
to the public</em>.</p>

<p>Dividends from its revenue can be made of 6, 8 or 10 per cent.
by changing the rates of freight and passage, at the discretion of
the Directors.</p>

<p>From some experience in the management of the business of
other roads, much less favorably situated than this, I feel no hesitation
in making this prediction. I look upon the result as one
upon which there can be no doubt entertained.</p>

<p>The inquiry may be made, "If this Road must prove a profitable
investment, why other works in Pennsylvania, favorably located,
have not yielded remunerating dividends to their proprietors?" In
reply it can be stated that there is no important work, leading from
Philadelphia, that ought not now to divide large profits, if their
stock and funded debts exhibited a fair cash value of the property
represented. Most, if not all, of these works, were commenced
with inadequate capital, for the object in view, and from the
anxiety of the stockholders to realize the large profits promised on
their completion, and the <em>public</em> to <em>enjoy the use</em> of the improvement,
they have been pressed forward faster than true economy,
or the funds of the company, would justify. Engagements were
made, relying upon fortune, or accident, to provide the means to
meet them. These resources failing, they were thrown upon the
mercy of either the contractors or the money lender. And, in consequence,
the cost of the works has been rolled up to an amount not
anticipated, and, in many cases, debts incurred, under the pressure
of the moment, in the most objectionable shape, to meet which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
whole of the receipts of the companies have necessarily been mortgaged.</p>

<p>In New England, and also in New York&mdash;where railroads have,
in many cases, been deprived of the privilege of carrying freight&mdash;judiciously
located roads have invariably paid well. Their success
has not been caused by the exercise of any peculiar skill or
economy in their management, as generally supposed, for, in this
respect, though they stand deservedly high, there is none that conduct
their business, under all circumstances, with as much economy
as the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, or some other southern companies.</p>

acknowledge the zealous and cordial co-operation that I have received
from my Associate and Assistant Engineers in carrying on

<p class="center smcap">By James J. Hill.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="negin1">[On the occasion of the completion of the Spokane, Portland &amp;
Seattle Ry., connecting Portland with British Columbia, Mr. Hill
delivered three noteworthy addresses at Portland, November 6,
1908, at Tacoma November 9 and Seattle November 10. The
speech at Portland was an earnest plea for a more intelligent and
economical cultivation and conservation of the vast agricultural
resources of the Pacific northwest; the other two related largely to
the part played by the railways in the development of that territory.
The portions of these addresses which follow are taken from
the full reports which appeared in the Seattle and Tacoma newspapers
the next days.]</p></div>


<p class="pfs80">MR. HILL AT SEATTLE.</p>

<p>After Mr. Hill had been introduced and warmly applauded as the
"Empire Builder," who had been intimately associated with the development
of the northern tier of states from the Lakes to the Pacific
Ocean, and he had acknowledged his obligation to the indomitable
spirit of Seattle and its people, he began his address by disclaiming
the ownership of the Great Northern railway. "Fifteen thousand
people own it." said he. "The average holding is about 120 shares.
Over 6,000 women are owners in the Great Northern railway, and
I have to manage their affairs." Then he proceeded:</p>

<p>"It is three years since I was here, and I never expected that
three months would pass without my coming to Seattle, but three
years have passed and what do I find? I think the city in three
years has doubled. I think it has doubled in everything that goes to
make a city. Just look at the streets lined with commercial houses
which would be a credit to any city in the world. It is far beyond
what I expected to find, and I think that Seattle has a future. Seattle
is entitled to her growth, and if the same spirit that has moved her
citizens in the past continues, if the mantle of the older men falls on
the shoulders of the younger men, Seattle cannot help but thrive. You
have behind you one of the richest states in the Union; one of the
very richest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="pfs80">DEVELOPMENT OF RAILWAYS.</p>

<p>"Now, to come back to the relation of the railway to the development
of the country. Next to the cultivation of the soil itself, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
amount of money invested and in the importance to all the people,
is the railway property of this country. It is on a little different
basis, I am sorry to say, from the general attitude of the public, from
any other property. From what Judge Burke says as to the Golden
Rule, if you can have it fairly applied, it would make our hearts glad.</p>

<p>"We frequently hear about railroad watered stock. It is a hackneyed
phrase which is used with which to catch gudgeons, and it
has caught a great many. Now, let us see. You can open a bank&mdash;five
of us sitting here, if we had the money, could open a bank, put
up the building and draw our checks, and that is disposed of. We
have a million or a million and a half of capital, and, conducting
the business of the bank within the law applied to bankers, we can
earn any dividend we like, and we can divide it, even up to 40 or 50
per cent., and it has been done, and nobody finds any fault. Now,
we might start a manufacturing establishment and we can divide
any profits that we can legally make up to 40 or 50 or 100 per cent.,
or we can start a mercantile establishment and conduct it so as to
bring any profit&mdash;there is no limit so long as we are within the laws
of trade. But take the railroad.</p>

<p>"Now, remember, you can run your manufacturing establishment
twenty-four hours a day, or you can run it one day in the week, or
you can run it half the time and you can close it and it will not
affect you, or you need not run it at all; and if you do not like the
business you can dispose of it. You can liquidate your bank and go
out of business; and so with the mercantile establishment, you can
close it at any time. But when you have invested your money in a
railway, you have undertaken an obligation to serve the public; you
have taken a business risk that is greater than the business risk of
any other business in the world. If you do not run it, move your
trains with regularity, move your trains so as to accommodate the
business, the courts will appoint a receiver and will issue receiver's
certificates to an extent that would wipe out your investment. If
there were anything left they would hand it back, but the chances
are altogether that if you could not make it pay the receiver could
not.</p>


<p class="pfs80">RAILROAD BIGGEST RISK.</p>

<p>"Now, I mention this simply to show that the business risk in
building or operating a railway is greater than it is in any other
business. There is nothing guaranteed, and sometimes you are told
what appliances you may use; you are told what you must not use;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
you are told whom you can hire, and you are told when you can
discharge him, and it has been at least hinted as to what you should
pay him&mdash;what his wages and condition of work shall be. So that
the only privilege that was left for the railroads was to pay the bills.
That they are always expected to do, and it would be a great disappointment
if they were not able to.</p>

<p>"In the section of this country, the portion of this country east of
Chicago, I do not know anywhere north of the Ohio River, where
a railroad, built with the greatest care and economy, could pay one
per cent. on its cost; that is, a new road, built between any of the
large cities of the west to the large cities of the east, paying the
present price of real estate and terminals and the cost of construction,
the cost of eliminating great profits, the cost of the necessary
expenditure of money to make life and limb safe.</p>

<p>"Take, for instance, a railroad from New York to Chicago. I
had curiosity enough to inquire from the leading real estate man
who was getting the additional property for the New York Central,
their terminals, what it would cost from Thirty-eighth street to
Harlem River, a narrow strip of blocks on the East Side, say ten
blocks, from Thirty-eighth to Forty-eighth street, to be used as a
terminal. He told me it ought to be secured for $200,000,000, but
he would not like to take the contract. Now, follow that up
through Albany and Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo and Erie and
Cleveland and on to Chicago, and if you can get into Chicago and
get out of New York with any reasonable cost I want to say that
when your road was finished, at the present rate, it could not pay
1 per cent. on what it cost in money.</p>


<p class="pfs80">NO ROOM FOR MORE ROADS.</p>

<p>"Now, what chance is there for more roads between New York
and Chicago, or between any Atlantic city and any large city in the
west? During the ten years from 1898 to 1908 the railroad mileage
in the United States increased about 24½ per cent., the passenger
business increased 125 per cent., and the freight business increased
148 per cent. The additional burden was placed on the railways,
with an increase of over 148 per cent. in the tons moved.
What is it costing the Pennsylvania road to get into the City of
New York? I do not know the exact figures, but I have seen
it estimated from time to time at one hundred millions of
dollars to secure passenger facilities in the City of New York.
When I think of these things and see what you have here I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that we have reason to congratulate ourselves, and I think that we
had a narrow escape from being compelled to do our business west of
Commercial street in place of where we are today. There are no
places that I know of today where there is any room or any use for
any other large railway enterprise.</p>

<p>"The Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul are coming to the Coast&mdash;and we are
glad they are there. At different times, when people largely interested
in that enterprise talked with me, I said, 'By all means build
to the Coast; extend your road&mdash;if you do not, somebody who has
more enterprise than you will take the business and will keep it on
their own rails and you will not get a share of it.' But when that
enterprise is finished, I do not know, north of the Platte River, where
there is room for another railroad or occasion for one. There will be
branches built, and they are necessary for the development of the
country. You had expended, and there is being expended now, a
very large sum during the last two years.</p>

<p>"The Northern Pacific and the Great Northern, within the State
of Washington, have spent millions of dollars between Portland
and Spokane. It ought not to frighten you; it will not wipe you
out; you have your roots deep in the ground and they will stay there.</p>


<p class="pfs80">TACOMA IS WAKING.</p>

<p>"Now, I find in summing up the present population of the new
country between Blaine and Vancouver&mdash;Portland is on the other
side of the Columbia, although, fortunately, the state line does not
limit our commerce or our right to trade with each other&mdash;there are
over 700,000 people living on the line of the railway between Blaine
and Vancouver. Portland claims 200,000, and I feel sure that she
must be near that figure. Portland has grown rapidly, and I think
possibly the young men have taken a sheet out of your book. There
was a time when they were altogether too wealthy in Portland.
Every man had business of his own to attend to and was so deeply
engaged in it that he overlooked the business of the city. They did
not take hold. You could come there if you were willing to bear all
the expense and take what you could get. But Portland has had an
awakening, and I believe that Portland, notwithstanding its remoteness
from the sea, will have a good growth. It has a good country
behind it and there is no reason why it should not have a good
growth.</p>

<p>"Another city down here where we were beautifully entertained
last night, Tacoma&mdash;I remember when we came out here they really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
did not need us and we did not want to force ourselves on them,
and so we stayed right here. But I think, and I hope, that Tacoma is
getting its eyes open and that it wants more railways. We don't ask
much; we want the privilege of a place for foothold, a place to do
our business at our own expense; and I think that we will probably
succeed in getting it&mdash;I hope so.</p>


<p class="pfs80">GROWTH PLEASES HIM.</p>

<p>"I wanted to come back to your city here. I was more than surprised
at your growth and I am more than gratified. I rather gathered
that you had grown fast and that possibly you wanted a resting
spell, but I don't see that there is any rest for you now. I think
that you will go on as you have begun, and I was more than glad to
see what you are doing in the way of adjusting your street grades.
It is inexpensive; the burden may be hard upon some people, and
difficult to carry, but it will cost infinitely less to do it now than in
five or ten years, after those streets were lined with buildings that
had cost a great deal of money and you could not afford to throw
them away. Lay your foundations right and the structure will take
care of itself.</p>

<p>"It will grow by degrees, and, when it is finished it will be part of
a complete whole and you will be glad you did it. We have a good
many communities to take care of along our railway, and with every
one of them we have always the feeling that their prosperity means
our prosperity. They have to earn the money before they can pay it
to us, and what they do pay us we think is a small part; but we
expect the railway business must depend upon close management and
small savings.</p>

<p>"Take the dividend of the Great Northern railway. <em>Three copper
cents in moving a ton of freight ten miles pays our dividends.</em> A ton
of freight on a country road would be a fair load for a farmer's
wagon, and ten miles would be a fair day's work if he returned the
same night. We do that. Our dividend amounts to about 3 cents&mdash;a
little less than three copper cents&mdash;for moving that load of
freight. We find that we have neither poisoned the air nor the water
and you have all the highways that you had before we came, but we
give you a better one and a cheaper one.</p>


<p class="pfs80">MUST HAVE MONEY.</p>

<p>"And remember that you never can injure the railway without
injuring yourselves. The railway has only two sources from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to get money. It must either earn it or borrow it, and if it borrows,
and borrows judiciously, the rate of interest ought not to be high,
but whatever it is, high or low, you pay it. Sometimes people who do
not know better think that they are serving a good cause to stick the
railway&mdash;the company is rich&mdash;a personal injury case or something
of that kind&mdash;but it is a railway and they can afford it&mdash;stick them.
Now, who pays the bill? Can we charge that up to the construction
of a station?</p>

<p>"It is a part of the expense, and the law says that you must pay
us for the use of our property enough to pay our expenses and our
taxes, and a reasonable return upon the investment, so that all is
charged in your bills.</p>

<p>"We had in one thriving city on the Great Northern, I recall, a suit
for $20,000. A young brakeman stumbled against a pile of cinders
that it was represented the trackmen threw out from between the
rails and poured water upon it, and it froze in the winter and was
solid, and as he was running alongside of his train he stumbled and
fell and was injured&mdash;some great injury to the spine that wrecked
his entire nervous system, and we inquired and found out how the
coal got there, and our experience and education have made us suspicious;
we took the cinders to the laboratory and had them analyzed
and absolutely they were anthracite, and there never was a ton of
anthracite coal burned in a locomotive in the State of Minnesota; we
followed it up and we found that the man who brought the suit&mdash;a
professional suit bringer&mdash;had, with a brakeman and his own son,
taken the cinders from his own office and piled them there and
poured water on them. Now, I speak of that just as an illustration
of some applications of that Golden Rule.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COMPARES RAILWAY COST.</p>

<p>"Your future growth will depend on yourselves hereafter, as it has
largely depended upon your own efforts in the past. The commerce
going to and from the Pacific Coast cities by the sea is being largely
carried in foreign bottoms. There was a time when the American
nation was a nation of seafaring men, but that does not apply any
longer, and I am sorry that that is so. I believe that the people of
the United States, I believe that the genius of the country is just
as able to carry upon the sea as upon the land. As matters stand
today, any bay or inlet where a foreign flag can force its way inland
into our country they can call to us to drop the bundle and they take
it from us and we can't help ourselves. Now, we ought to be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
to help ourselves, for on the land we have so far surpassed the
others that there is no comparison.</p>

<p>"In Great Britain their average railway cost is $234,000 per mile.
In the United States it is a little less than $60,000 per mile. In
Germany it is about $110,000, in France about $140,000, in Austria
about the same. Now let us see what they do with their two hundred
and thirty-four thousand dollar machine and their one hundred and
ten and one hundred and forty. In Great Britain they move an
average of five hundred thousand ton miles to the mile of road at
a cost of $2.16 for every hundred miles. In Germany they move
about seven hundred thousand ton miles at a cost of a trifle under
$1.36 for every hundred miles. In France 450,000 ton miles at a cost
of $1.40 for every hundred miles. In Austria the cost is $1.50 for
moving a ton of freight a hundred miles, and in the United States the
cost is 74 cents and a fraction.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AGAINST SHIP SUBSIDY.</p>

<p>"Now we in the United States move the business for less than
half the average cost of Europe. We pay from twice to four times
the rate of wages, and we do it with an investment of about a third
of their average. If we can do that on land, why can't we do it on
the sea? I know that if the ships of the United States had the same
care and the same opportunity that the ships of other nations have
they would do it, and until then no subsidy, no ship subsidy, will
ever enable them to compete with other business, because in principle
it is wrong to tax all the business of the country&mdash;to put your hand
into the public treasury and hand out to one particular business a
cash subsidy in order that it may live.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you that a steamship line that cannot live without
a cash subsidy will make a mighty, mighty lean race with one. It
ought to rest on a business foundation. That is the only reason for
running ships, because they can be made to pay, and if we can
make our railways pay and work at the low rates that the railways
in the United States do carry and pay the scale of wages that they
do pay, why can't we succeed on the high seas? If we can't, let us
hand that business over to somebody who will do it cheaper and
better; but I don't feel that the case is a hopeless one, but, on the
other hand, I do feel that it would only limit the efforts of those
who were trying to make and to build up a merchant marine for the
United States; it would only limit their efforts to extend a subsidy
to a few ships engaged in the business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs80">FOREIGNERS GET SUBSIDY.</p>

<p>"I remember on one occasion that I went home from here and
there was no tonnage to move the stuff we had to send to the Orient.
Absolutely no tonnage was available, and when I got home there was
a reception to one of our public men, and the late Senator Mark
Hanna was there. I took up in a few remarks the question of a
subsidy, and I said. 'If we are going to have one, let us pay a subsidy
for something that is going to do us some good. Let us pay a tonnage
on the actual products that reach a new market.'</p>

<p>"That would have done some good. The tonnage of the products
that does not reach a new market, we wouldn't have anything to
pay on that, and on that that does we could afford to pay. Now, we
were driven out of the business on the Atlantic, but we might retain
a hold upon the business of this ocean. Immediately there was a
scheme for Congress for an appropriation, I think of $9,000,000, for
ship subsidies, and they found that 80 per cent. of it would go to one
line, under the bill that was being then drawn&mdash;and that line on the
Atlantic Ocean&mdash;and I know that the men and most of the officers
lived on the other side of the Atlantic, and the stock was owned on
the other side of the Atlantic. Now that would not build up a
merchant marine for us.</p>

<p>"A company over there has disposed of this old boat to our people
and taken what new money they got and built new boats. That was
all and that was celebrated&mdash;a portion of that was celebrated as the
inauguration of a new merchant marine for the United States.
Think of it!</p>

<p>"But some of our statesmen were wise enough to believe that it
was going to succeed, but it did not. It fell ingloriously. When we
have a merchant marine it will be because there is a reason for it.
But until that time comes, just put up with the business that we can
get, and let the others carry it who can carry it lower and better than
we can in this country.</p>

<p>"But bear this in mind: That all your great harbors in the country
when compared with the railroad yards sink into insignificance in
the tonnage that they move. I think that, in Seattle, I would be safe
in saying that twenty tons are moved by rail where one goes by
water, unless you can count saw logs. And I had occasion to look up
St. Louis. The Mississippi at St. Louis has from eight to twelve
feet of water for nearly nine months in the year and boats run in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and out of St. Louis, and we are all anxious to make a deep water
channel from there to New Orleans.</p>

<p>"Now, in looking up the amount, I found that, notwithstanding
they had from eight to twelve feet of water for nine months in the
year, or about nine months, less than 1 per cent. of the tonnage that
came into St. Louis moved by water; and out of over 1,500,000 tons
of coal&mdash;and if there is any article among all the shipments that could
be moved by water easily and cheaply it would be coal&mdash;not one ton
of coal moved out of St. Louis by water last year.</p>

<p>"There is a scheme to spend the public money and create a channel
fourteen feet deep to the levees at the mouth of the Mississippi,
and there are plans to lath and plaster the bottoms of a great many
other streams throughout the country, and so many that in order to
get any appropriation for an enterprise of great national merit, it is
necessary to divide up and load it down with a lot of appropriations.
These make what is known as the pork barrel, the river and harbor
bill. They load it down with the various enterprises that have no
value to anybody, streams on which the government is called to
spend more money than all the boats would bring if sold at auction,
and in some cases where there have been no boats run for ten years.</p>


<p class="pfs80">LEADS WORLD IN TONNAGE.</p>

<p>"They say they ought to regulate the railroads. Now, when you
come to consider the matter practically, I would rather have a railroad
alongside of a navigable river, or a river with six or eight or
ten feet of water in it, than to have it far away from the river. A
box car will beat any ten-foot channel in the world, but when we get
twenty or twenty-five-foot channels, the box car is not in it in
bulky freight. You have got to have depth of water.</p>

<p>"Some years ago I built six freight steamers on the Great Lakes
and they were considered whales in their day. They could carry
3,000 tons. Today a lake steamer and a double channel through
the Soo Canal carries 12,000 tons, and has two additional firemen
and one deckhand, and that is all the additional crew.</p>

<p>"Sometime I would like to have the city council of the City of
Seattle, if they had the time, run down to the head of Lake Superior,
and see what is the greatest port in the matter of tons moved in the
world. London was, and Duluth and Superior a few years ago were
trailing along fifth or sixth place; but last year it took first place
with the cities of the world, and it handled more tonnage than any
other city. London had 30,000,000 tons and Duluth had 34,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, to show the enormous importance of that load of tonnage,
that tonnage that is greater than any other city in the world, I
undertake to say, and do say, that there are not 1,000 people, men,
women and children, connected directly or indirectly, with moving
that traffic between the land and the water in both directions. There
is such a thing as doing a very large business without a harbor at all.</p>


<p class="pfs80">SEATTLE SPIRIT WINS.</p>

<p>"Although as far as foreign commerce is concerned, as far as
business is concerned, when we get to the seaside, we have to hand
it over to the ships. It must be done. But the great business is
done in the railroad yards. I would not be without the harbor&mdash;far
from it, but don't feel that the harbor is going to make you, and
don't feel as a gentleman in public life in Washington, when a friend
of mine talking with him said, 'You won't get any more railways
built along the policies you advocate.' 'Oh, well,' he said, 'we have
got them, we have got them.' And he was a member of the house
committee of interstate commerce, a rather dangerous statement for
him to make."</p>


<p class="pfs80">AT TACOMA.</p>

<p>In his address at the banquet of the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce
on the preceding evening (November 9), Mr. Hill dwelt
especially on the intimate relation of railway and agriculture interests.
Among other things he said:</p>

<p>"The question of terminals means a great deal to a railroad and it
is getting to be more and more full of meaning every year. Some
cities, and large cities, today have all the railroads they will ever
get, simply on account of the difficulty in getting terminals. I
think the Northern Pacific terminals today&mdash;I think to buy them
on the entire system&mdash;would cost more money than to grade the
whole road, and I do not know but what it would cost more than to
grade and put the rails down. That is a condition and, remember,
that you pay the freight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="pfs80">WILL SOON NEED ALL THE WHEAT WE RAISE.</p>

<p>"Within a comparatively short time, I will say that within six
years, I will go on record, you won't send many cargoes of wheat
from Tacoma by sea, simply because the United States wants every
bushel that will be raised within the United States to feed her own
people, and will pay you more money for it. If they didn't pay you
more money for it, it would go to the foreigner, but our own people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
will pay more money for it and take it somewhere and grind it into
flour. If you look for greater avenues or greater economy in transportation,
but it will cease to go out as wheat. I will give you an
illustration and you can draw your own conclusions as well as I
can: In 1882 the United Slates raised 504,000,000 bushels of wheat
and we had 52,000,000 people and we exported somewhere between
175,000,000 and 200,000,000 bushels. Twenty-five years later, in
1907, we raised 634,000,000 bushels. We increased in that twenty-five
years a little less than 25 per cent. in our wheat yield, or
130,000,000 bushels.</p>

<p>"Our population increased 64 per cent., and converging lines meet
somewhere. Now, if we had 90,000,000 of people&mdash;and we have between
88,000,000 and 90,000,000 this year&mdash;and use six and a half
bushels per capita, it would take 585,000,000 bushels for bread and
seed. Professor Rogers, of the Minnesota Agricultural College, puts
our consumption for bread and seed for the last few years at a trifle
over or a trifle under seven bushels. I think he uses ten years for
his average, and I use twenty-five to get an average of about six
bushels and forty pounds, and I call it six and one-half bushels.</p>

<p>"On last year's crop, with 634,000,000, we have had about
59,000,000 bushels to sell and we sold about 80,000,000. What is
the result? After the 15th of January wheat was higher in Minneapolis
than it was in Chicago, even up to the first of August, and
part of the time it was higher than it was in New York, because
they wanted it to make a loaf of bread to feed our people at home.</p>

<p>"We have not the great margin that we used to have. The seed
on last year's crop went down to 59,000,000 bushels and, if my
figures are equal to Professor Rogers'&mdash;and he is a professor of
agriculture in the Agricultural College and maybe he has more time
to look these questions up more carefully&mdash;but with his figures we
hadn't a bushel to sell. Suppose we had 60,000,000 bushels to sell,
and we are increasing in population at the rate of 2,000,000 per
year, our natural figure is between 1,300,000 and 1,400,000, and
allow 700,000 for immigration, not eleven, twelve, thirteen or fourteen
as we have been having, but say seven and by 1950 you will
have in the United States, it figures out to be accurate, 208,000,000,
but suppose we have 200,000,000, it might come by 1945, or 1947,
or it might be in 1955, but about that time we will have 200,000,000
people, and if they use six and a half bushels per capita for bread
and seed, it would take 1,300,000,000 bushels to feed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs80">PROBLEM OF THE WHEAT.</p>

<p>"That is a little more than twice what you are raising today, and
you haven't any new fields to put a new plow in. From 1882, when
we raised 504,000,000 bushels of wheat, following that time more
than half of Minnesota, all the northern part of Minnesota, was
brought under the plow, all of North Dakota, all of South Dakota,
all of the state of Washington and all of Oregon, except 3,000,000
or 4,000,000 bushels raised in 1882, more than half of California,
two-thirds or three-quarters in Kansas and Nebraska, a large part,
practically all of Oklahoma or the Indian Territory and a large part
of Texas, and take what was raised in 1907 on the new fields that
were opened up, any new territory after 1882, and you will find that
it is approaching 300,000,000 bushels, but the increase in the whole
country in that twenty-five years was only 130,000,000 bushels, so
that the old fields fell off about 170,000,000 bushels.</p>

<p>"Are we increasing our yield per acre? By no manner of means.
It has been a steady and uniform decline for the past thirty years.
Now, we have as good wheat fields as there are anywhere on the
continent, and they will be made better. I am not a disciple of
Malthus, because Malthus was an honest man no doubt, but when
he wrote he did not understand the science of modern agriculture
or the adaptation of the soil or of the seed to the soil, or the commercial
value of a correct analysis of the soil and the adaptation
of the soil nor its commercial value as suited to the crop it is best
fitted for. All these things we have learned, and while you are
teaching your young people let me advise you that the school that is
most entitled to your care and the school that will do the most for
the state in every place and will turn out men and women as they
have always in industry and intelligence and everything else that goes
to make good citizenship, the school attended by the boy on the
farm is certainly as good as the best.</p>

<p>"When your forests are cut and hauled away, and sold to somebody
else you have then, and we will give you a perennial forest, a
crop every year of great value too. But we ought to be able to take
care of our land and we will. I have no doubt about the future.
We will do what other people have been compelled to do. In 1790,
Great Britain was down to fourteen bushels. We are down to
thirteen and nine-tenths now, average. They took the question up
and it was much easier for them to control, as far as territory was
concerned, because the territory was small, in the hands of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
land owners, mostly rented, and they faced conditions compelling the
land owner to sub-fallow, and fertilize and carry one crop year after
year. They appointed a royal commission and that royal commission
went to work jointly. We have a royal commission, too, and
they are able men. One is a professor at Cornell and another is
a publisher of books in New York, and another is Mr. Pinchot,
who is doing a great deal of work, but he is overrun with the work
he has to do. This commission is to report in time for the meeting
of Congress. Now, bear this in mind, Great Britain started in 1790
trying to keep the people on the land. The landlord was afraid of
the great drift of the agricultural people to the colonies and the new
republic, the United States at that time. The new republic was
going to impoverish them, and leave them without any rent rolls.
They went to work intelligently and in 1810 and 1811 Sir Humphrey
David, the foremost scientist of his time, delivered most intelligent
lectures on the qualities of the soil. In forty or fifty years after they
started they had gotten their yield up to an average of twenty-five
bushels per acre. Last year, it was 32.2. Starting at fourteen we
ought to get up in place of 13.9 or 14, we ought to be able to get up
to 28 or 30, and if we do we will have grain to feed our 200,000,000
people and to spare, and what do I hear? 'Some more, and then
some?' Now in going over those questions, I am not worrying about
the future of the country. I have more confidence in it today, the
day for cheap wheat has left the United States, not to return, and
we can stand that. This land, this side of the range, you can devote
to better uses than raising wheat. I do not know why you should not
get returns, as I said, that would equal 10 per cent. on $2,000 per
acre. You can do it. There is no question as to that."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Abstract of Address before Southern Commercial Congress
Washington, D. C., Dec. 7 and 8, 1908.</p></div>


<p>This question has been extensively treated by leading railroad
men, statesmen and Press of the South, and admirably covered
by addresses on numerous occasions before various audiences
throughout the South.</p>

<p>I therefore feel that the southern railroad situation is gradually
becoming better understood, not only by the public at large, but
by the railway men of the South, who are jointly appreciative of
the fact that the greatest need of southern railroads is the confidence
and support of the communities through which they run and serve.</p>

<p>Therefore, my remarks will be few, and are made in order that
certain fundamentals may be read into the record of this convention.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this address the South is described as that
portion of the United States lying south of the Potomac and Ohio
Rivers and east of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Shortly after the close of the Civil war, the South realizing the
changed order of things, accepted the situation in the spirit of
American manhood and started on a new era of industrial and
commercial development.</p>

<p>One of the first necessities was a comprehensive system of transportation
facilities. The railroads, which prior to the Civil war had
compared favorably with those in the North, at its close were
practically bankrupt financially and physically, and were more the
shadow than the substance of what they should have been.</p>

<p>Southerners with brains and energy, starting with 11,587 miles
of detached, dilapidated and crippled railways, immediately commenced
to lay the foundation of the present industrial and commercial
prosperity in the South by constructing its lines of railway.</p>

<p>The efforts of these men and the confidence they were able to
inspire in northern and foreign capital are best illustrated by the
fact that today the South is served with 46,434 miles of railroad,
serving eleven states, twenty million people, and representing a
total investment in round numbers of two billion dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these 46,434 miles of railroads only 1,134 miles approximately,
or 2½ percent, are double track. It is possible that the next ten
years will see at least one-fourth, or over ten thousand, additional
miles of second track.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that while transportation is the burden
bearer of both production and commerce, it is only able to perform
the full and complete measure of its functions when properly
nourished and assisted by finance.</p>

<p>In ancient days the birth of civilization started with the ability
to preserve food products. This grew from the temporary necessity
of accumulating sufficient food to last from one chase to
another, or to enable journeys to be performed or winter climates
endured, to the storage of vast quantities of food to enable nations
to survive years of famine, as was exemplified by the storage of
grain in Egypt in the days of Joseph, which period history shows
us was the crowning epoch of Egyptian civilization.</p>

<p>Today the measure of our modern civilization is our transportation
facilities. Safe, efficient and rapid communication, and the
economy of the world's transportation systems, are binding the
nations of the earth closer together day by day, and helping to
create the conditions which will ultimately place the crown of accomplishment
upon our modern civilization.</p>

<p>Coming back to the South, from which we have been temporarily
led astray, it is self-evident to the careful observer that all the
diverse interests of this section&mdash;agriculture, mining, manufacture,
commerce and banking&mdash;are unavoidably and irrevocably bound up
with the transportation facilities furnished and to be furnished by
the railway systems ramifying its territory and performing a service
for the South similar to that performed by the arteries and blood-vessels
in the body of corporeal man.</p>

<p>It is also apparent to the impartial observer that if the South
is to reach its highest state of development its transportation facilities
should not lag, but should lead the march of progress, and that
this development should be stimulated in every possible way; and
men of the South should never forget for a single moment that
<em>the needs of the railroads are the needs of the South</em>.</p>

<p>It has been our custom in America to anticipate future needs in
transportation, and in a measure attempt to forestall and provide
for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The policy of foreign countries has been practically the reverse.
The railway systems of England have been constructed to take care
of and supply a demand for transportation facilities that already
existed.</p>

<p>The railroads of the United States in the South and West have
been projected and constructed, and to a great extent financed, by
men whose inspiration was a firm belief in an unseen future and
whose assets were largely composed of hope and an undying faith
in the future development of their country.</p>

<p>Now, the future demands for increased transportation facilities
in the South are plainly indicated by past records, showing the
growth of productive activities and the constant increase of tonnage
to be moved.</p>

<p>If these requirements are to be met, demand and supply must
move forward hand in hand. Additional tonnage will justify increased
facilities and increased facilities will stimulate still greater
tonnage.</p>

<p>During the past 25 years the total products of the South, from
agriculture, forest, mines and manufactures, have increased in valuation
over 225 per cent. During the last five years of this period,
ending in 1906, the increase has been 50 per cent.</p>

<p>The common fallacy that a railroad is completed when opened for
traffic has long since passed away, at least in the minds of intelligent
men.</p>

<p>The railroad of today is no sooner completed as a single track,
than it becomes necessary to provide industrial spurs; additional or
enlarged terminals; replace its temporary structures by permanent
ones; widen its excavations; strengthen its embankments; provide
passing tracks, additional shop facilities, enlarged passenger and
freight stations, warehouses, elevators, docks and wharves at water
terminals, additional tracks, heavier rail, rock ballast, elimination
of curves, reduction of grades, block signals, elimination of grade
crossings, heavier engines, larger and better cars, to the end that
the constantly growing requirements and exactions of modern traffic
conditions may be met; all of which requires increased expenditures,
which it is easily seen could not in any event be provided for out
of earnings.</p>

<p>During the next ten years the railroads of the South will require
$1,000,000,000 to enable them to fully provide for the increased
demands for transportation facilities, an average of $100,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
per annum. Including the estimated increased mileage and the
present capital investment, the resulting average capitalization would
amount to $53,000 per mile, being $20,000 per mile under the present
average capitalization of all the railroads of the United States
today, which is $73,000 per mile.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Meeting the requirements of the railroad situation in the South
by the expenditure of a round billion dollars during the next ten
years, as outlined herein, would make the total investment in southern
railways at the end of that period three billions of dollars on an
estimated mileage of 56,000.</p>

<p>It would require average earnings of $9,000 gross per mile per
annum, with operating expenses at 70 per cent of the gross, to yield
sufficient net income to provide a return of 5 per cent on this total
investment.</p>

<p>When these figures are compared with the present average gross
earnings of the railroads of the United States, $11,400 per mile per
annum, with an average cost of operation of $7,757 per annum,
resulting in a ratio of operating expenses to gross earnings of
68 per cent, the above estimates appear reasonable and conservative.</p>

<p>Even if this expenditure is made and the results predicted obtained
at the end of the ten-year period, southern railroads will still
fall approximately 25 per cent short of yielding the present average
gross earnings per mile per annum of the railroads of the United
States today.</p>

<p>To provide funds to meet these ever-growing and incessant demands
for additional facilities, the railroad companies must necessarily
be large borrowers.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the South in the next decade, and in those to
follow after, depends upon the ability of the owners and managers
of southern railways to foresee and provide for future necessities,
and upon the promptness with which the work is accomplished.</p>

<p>The ability of railroads to construct these improvements, which
are so essential to the future prosperity of the South, depends
upon the willingness of capital to furnish the necessary funds for
the purpose.</p>

<p>While legislation may control and regulate the returns upon invested
capital, there is no process by which it can compel that investment
originally. While investment is easily retarded it is difficult
to attract.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>There is probably no form of capital investment more open to
attack or more liable to depreciation through unfair or unwise legislation
than the railway investments of today.</p>

<p>While the speaker is a firm believer in the principles of governmental
control and supervision over the corporate entities which
have been created by the people and for the people, it must not be
forgotten that every shield has its reverse, and that the exercise of
such control and supervision must necessarily be along the lines
of right and justice, which no mere legislative enactment can change.
Any variance brings its own reward, which frequently spells disaster.</p>

<p>The power to control, regulate and supervise necessarily carries
with it responsibilities from which there can be no escape.</p>

<p>Every tax, every restriction, every requirement which costs money
or reduces revenue to our southern railroads is a tax which must
ultimately be paid by the communities which they serve.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the southern railroads and the prosperity of
the South are irrevocably bound together, and the <em>needs of the
South are identical with the needs of the railroads</em>.</p>

<p>The basis of securing capital must necessarily be the ability of
the borrower to inspire confidence in the lender that his capital will
ultimately be returned to him intact, and that he will receive regularly
and promptly adequate hire therefor.</p>

<p>No section of our great country has such reputation for united
action as the South. In political matters this unity of action for
years has led to the designation "The Solid South."</p>

<p>What the railroads in this section need today is <em>a solid South
behind and beneath them</em>; a solid South taking a calm and rational
view of the immense factor the railways have been and always will
be in the development of its future greatness.</p>

<p>The recent reversion of sentiment in the State of Georgia, brought
about by a calm and deliberate analysis of the present situation by
the business men of that State, should be the keynote of the future
action of the solid South.</p>

<p><em>The adoption of a policy of fairness and liberality towards the
railroad interests on behalf of all the Southern States, and the ability
to convince the financial world that this action is sincere and genuine
and will be permanent, is the great paramount need of the railroads
of the South today.</em></p>

<p>Prompt action along these lines will enable the railroad companies
of this section to successfully compete in the markets of the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
for the capital needed to carry out the improvements outlined, and
thus provide the facilities which will enable the producers of the
South to ride the crest of the wave of coming prosperity.</p>

<p>In its calls for capital the southern railroads must come into competition
in the markets of the world, not only with the railroad
requirements of the North, of the East and the West, but with all
the lines of human industry and endeavor throughout the wide world.</p>

<p>The difference between the five or six per cent paid by southern
railroads for the money which goes into their additional facilities or
equipment, and the three or four per cent which may be yielded by
the high-class world investments, is merely the gauge by which the
confidence of the capitalist is measured in the integrity of his
investments.</p>

<p>Today it is difficult to secure money for railroad development,
either South or North, at any ordinary rate of interest. Why? Is
it because money is scarce? No.</p>

<p>I can best answer this by a story of the panic of '93, when a citizen
of Chicago dropped into the office of Lyman Gage, of the First
National Bank of that city, and inquired of Mr. Gage if money was
tight. He replied, "No, the bank had plenty of money." The citizen
said, "That's fine; can I secure a loan of $100,000?" Mr. Gage
replied, "Yes, you can have it; we will loan it to you. What is your
collateral, what security can you give?" It is needless to say that
the loan was not made.</p>

<p>The customer afterwards remarked to a friend that he had found
that the trouble was not that money was tight, or that money was
scarce, but was due to the scarcity of collateral or security, which
is only another designation for guaranteed confidence.</p>

<p>This is the situation today. There is not a railroad in the South,
North, East or West that could not secure all of the funds necessary
for any development it might desire to make provided it could show
the capitalists to whom application for the loan was made that it
could furnish security which would insure the repayment of the
loan and the interest thereon as due.</p>

<p>I doubt if there is a single southern railway system, the officers
of which would not gladly today take up, consider and block out a
scheme for the improvement and betterment of their property, and
commence preparations to enable their system to fully perform the
increased functions of a common carrier, which the abundant years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of the immediate future promise to require, if they could be sure,
and in turn could assure their financial backers, that the earnings
of their road would be amply and safely sufficient to provide for,
and take care of, the investment necessary.</p>

<p>Therefore, <em>remember that the needs of the railroads are the needs
of the South</em>.</p>

<p>I presume there is no planter, miner, manufacturer, producer of
any sort, banker, merchant or professional man in the wide South
who would not say in a moment that every thousand dollars of
capital invested in his vicinity, or in his town, or in his state, would
be gladly welcomed and eagerly sought for, by the planter paying
eight per cent and the merchant and miscellaneous producer from
six to eight per cent, and that approximately one billion of dollars
injected into the commercial channels of the southern states during
the next ten years would bring a relative measure of prosperity to
every man, woman and child within its borders.</p>

<p>When it is considered that this amount of money could be invested
in additional railroad improvements and facilities; that under proper
conditions it could be secured at a rate not in excess of five per
cent; that approximately eighty per cent or more would be spent
for southern labor and southern material, and would find its way
through every artery and vein of southern trade and commerce, it
would seem that the solid South would be thoroughly alive to the
burning fact that&mdash;<em>The needs of the railroads are the needs of the
South</em>.</p>

<p>I might talk to you for hours about the evil and unfairness of
legislative enactments to retard and make unproductive railway
investments; of the injustice of any body of men attempting by legislation,
without giving the railroad corporations proper hearing, to
arbitrarily adjust their rates of toll for either passenger or freight
simply because politicians consider it a popular thing to do.</p>

<p>I might suggest a multitude of things which could be done to
increase the credit of railroads throughout your section.</p>

<p>I might mention a multitude of things which have been done to
injure and impair and prevent railroads securing the necessary
capital to provide for their needs.</p>

<p>I might also attempt to enumerate the ill-advised actions of railroad
managers and employees toward the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>I might expatiate upon the foolishness and unwisdom of a corporation&mdash;the
creature of the public&mdash;attempting to dictate to its
master or declining to obey its commands.</p>

<p>It is doubtful, however, if the enumeration of the errors and
shortcomings of the fellow-members of the same family ever tends
to a better understanding or more harmonious relationships. The
need of the hour is a recognition of the interdependent relations
which exist between us all, and to remember&mdash;intensely, actively,
potently remember&mdash;that an "injury to one is an injury to all," and
that "united we stand, divided we fall."</p>

RAILWAYS</a></h2>

<p class="center smcap">By Daniel Willard,<br />
President of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="negin2">[An Address delivered at Galesburg, Illinois, to Burlington Railroad
Employes, February 20, 1909, by Mr. Willard, then Second
Vice-President of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad
Company.]</p></div>


<p>A short time ago I had occasion to explain to some of your associates
who happened to be in my office, some of the difficulties the
railroads had been contending with during the two years just past,
and I was asked if I would be willing to come to Galesburg and
explain to other Burlington employes the things I had endeavored
to make clear to them. I replied that I would be very glad to do so,
and I suppose that is how I happen to be here tonight.</p>

<p>I understand that this audience is composed largely of employes of
the Burlington Railroad Company, and I am glad that that is so, and
what I shall say will be addressed particularly to them.</p>

<p>So much has been said and written about railroads during the last
two years, and by many well qualified to do both, as well as by some
not qualified to do either, that it can hardly be possible that any new
thing remains to be said, and I fear I shall only be able this evening
to repeat to you collectively the same things I have already said to
many of you individually.</p>

<p>Under the Burlington plan of organization the Second Vice-President
has direct charge of the operation of the line (responsible, of
course, to the President), and for the last five years I have had the
privilege and honor of holding that office. I refer to this only that
I may by so doing establish my relationship with the various matters
to which I shall later specifically refer, because I propose to confine
my remarks chiefly to home matters; that is to say, to matters pertaining
directly to the Burlington Company. I feel that I ought to
be qualified to speak clearly on that subject, and while I have
naturally read much concerning the general railroad question as a
whole, the same sources of information have also been open to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I have no doubt many of you have given the general subject as
much or even more study than I have.</p>

<p>In October, 1907&mdash;16 months ago&mdash;the Burlington Company did
the largest business in its entire history&mdash;ran the most trains, earned
the most money and employed the most men. During that month the
names of 53,000 men appeared upon its pay-rolls; and the same condition
existed quite generally throughout the entire United States.
There was a well-nigh universal complaint of car shortage and lack
of motive power.</p>

<p>Four months later, reports from the Car Efficiency Bureau in Chicago
showed a surplus of over 325,000 freight cars on the American
railroads. In the meantime the Burlington Company had reduced its
force by nearly 18,000 men and it was estimated that the transportation
business of the country had fallen off more than 30 per cent.</p>

<p>What caused this unprecedented change? Men far abler than I
have undertaken to explain, and many reasons have been given, all,
I presume, more or less in harmony with the facts, but influenced no
doubt by each man's point of view. I say, candidly, I do not know
what caused it; that is, assuming that there <em>was any one cause</em>, but I
think I can point out to you <em>some</em> of the <em>contributing</em> causes, at least
so far as the Burlington Company is concerned.</p>

<p>A railroad, as you all well know, is a living, growing thing. It is
never finished, or if we think we have finished some certain part, as
was probably thought when the original stone engine houses were
built here some years ago, or when the first bridge was built across
the Mississippi River at Burlington, it always happens that heavier,
larger, and longer engines come along in course of time, forced upon
us by the changed conditions, and our engine house which was built
for all time becomes too short, and our bridge is too light, and both
must be rebuilt. The same thing is going on in every department of
railroad operations&mdash;ballast, ties, rails, coaches, station buildings,
even grades and curvature, all come within the changing influence
of time and progress. I referred to the engine house specifically
simply to illustrate my point.</p>

<p>Because of the constant change or evolution which is going on,
it is necessary that Railroad Companies, if they expect to keep
abreast of the times, should make annually large expenditures for
such improvements as from time to time become desirable or necessary,
if the standard of service is to be raised, or even maintained.
These are called extraordinary expenditures, and it is customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
on this Line to prepare each year, as of January 1st, what is called
a Budget, being in effect a list of the more important improvements
considered necessary by the officers of the Road. The Budget shows
the separate items, with description of each, and also estimated cost.
It may and does include such items as new cars or engines needed,
additional sidetracks, new terminal yards, such as you have here,
water treating plants, new coal chutes, etc.</p>

<p>On January 1, 1907, the sum total of the Burlington Budget, as it
stood approved by the President on that date, amounted to something
over $16,000,000.00. It included some new equipment and also some
quite large improvements, such as new yard at Lincoln, grade reductions
between Galesburg and Savanna, etc.</p>

<p>The Burlington System is over 9,000 miles in length, and goes
through parts of eleven different states. On the 1st of January,
1907, the legislatures in all of the eleven states, I think, were in
session. The Federal Congress was also in session at Washington.
Bills having special reference to railroads were being introduced
daily in some of the legislative bodies above mentioned. I cannot
say now that all of them were against the railroads, but I feel I am
justified in saying that while perhaps some of them if passed might
not have injured the railroads much, none, or at most very few,
were intended to help the roads. In fact, the attitude of the Federal
Congress as well as of most of the state legislatures was considered
by nearly all railroad owners, and officers as well, as distinctly hostile.
This belief may or may not have been justified by the facts&mdash;at any
rate it existed. The owners of the Burlington Company believed it.
Its executive officers believed it. I believed it.</p>

<p>The number of bills affecting railroads introduced in the legislatures
of the eleven states above referred to, and in the Federal Congress,
during the session of Winter of 1906-1907 was over 800&mdash;at
least, over 800 such bills were actually laid upon my desk. Among
these were bills reducing the passenger fares in several states; others
about reciprocal demurrage&mdash;if any one can explain how such a
matter can be made reciprocal; still others fixing the speed of stock
trains, and the size of caboose cars; fixing the hours of labor for
men in certain branches of the service (and I wish to say here that
that part of the Federal law fixing limit of hours for men in train
and engine service has my hearty support); bills having reference
to the liability of the railroads to their patrons and employes, etc., etc.
I do not wish you to understand that I criticise all, or for that matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
any, of the bills by this enumeration. I am now simply reciting the
facts. But whether the bills were good or bad, desirable or undesirable,
it was clear if some of them became laws that the expenses of
the railroads would in consequence be largely increased, and no way
was provided whereby the revenue or earnings would be correspondingly
raised&mdash;in fact, there seemed to be a demand from all directions
that rates should be reduced, and they were reduced in many
states.</p>

<p>Another important movement was also under way at the same
time, and that was in the direction of a general wage increase in
practically all departments. This one item alone cost the Burlington
Company $3,000,000.00 a year.</p>

<p>Now, what effect do you suppose all these things had upon the
Budget and similar questions? Just the same effect that the same
kind of questions in a personal way would have had upon you and
your personal affairs.</p>

<p>You will remember that I said the Budget amounted to $16,000,000
on January 1, 1907. That was just before this wave of anti-railroad
legislation referred to had fully developed; but when we saw what
was happening, when we read the bills that were being passed daily,
and the others that were under consideration, we became very much
concerned. It seemed clear to us that even if business continued
good&mdash;and remember this was ten months before the panic of
November&mdash;that our earnings would probably be considerably reduced
by the reduction of freight and passenger rates in various
states, and our expenses were certain to be much increased by some
of the legislation and also by the advance in wages, and it was necessary
to consider where the money was coming from to pay the large
bills that would come due in connection with the Budget program.
After considering the matter very carefully early in January, we
decided, first, not to authorize anything further in the way of improvements
unless actually necessary; and, second, to stop as many
things already authorized as it was possible to get along without.
Among the things so put off or deferred were the building of a new
engine house and necessary shop buildings at Clyde; the construction
of a new line about 55 miles in length from Herrin to the Ohio
River; double track between Galesburg and Bushnell; new passenger
depots at Monmouth and several other places; work on new terminals
at Lincoln, etc. Of course, it may not have seemed to you at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the time that we were stopping, because we still had so many things
under way, and you cannot prudently stop large undertakings all at
once&mdash;for instance, we could not stop work on the new yard at
Galesburg when it was half done, and you will recall that it required
more than two years to complete the plan, but we did slow up as
much as possible; that is to say, we tried to finish up such things
as were authorized before January 1, 1907, and which were still considered
necessary, but we did not start any new things. The effect
of this is best shown by the size of the Budget on January 1, 1908&mdash;it
was then a little over $8,000,000.00, or about one-half what is was
twelve months before. In the meantime the November panic of 1907
had come upon us, and it seemed not only best, but necessary, to
continue the policy decided upon in January of that year, and on
the 1st of January, 1909, the Budget, as it then stood, and as it now
stands, amounts to a little less than $1,000,000.00; and this brings us
up to the present time.</p>

<p>In February, 1907, I had the honor to be invited to the annual
banquet of the Commercial Club at Clarinda, Iowa, and I was asked
to speak about the railroad situation. After referring to some of the
proposed laws that were then under consideration in the various
states, I continued as follows: "I will not speak of the probable
effect of such a public policy as I have referred to, on the general
railroad situation, as others are much better qualified to do that, but
speaking for the Company which I represent, we view the situation
with much concern, and we have done, I think, what any prudent
manager would do if he saw confronting him conditions which he
was certain would increase his cost of operation a large but unknown
amount and at the same time reduce his revenues&mdash;we have planned
to curtail our expenditures wherever possible. I do not mean that
we shall let the property suffer, or lower the character of the service,
but we will not undertake extensions or large improvements
until we can see more clearly where the money is coming from, or if
it comes at all. How far reaching this policy of retrenchment, or
perhaps I should say curtailment, will be, I, at least, cannot say;
it will depend upon the future. Certain it is that our expenditures
in that direction will be much less this year than last, which
means, of course, fewer men employed and less material purchased."
It is two years since that was written, and I regret to
say that circumstances have not yet seemed to justify any considerable
change of policy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The Burlington Company has on its pay-rolls today about 38,000
men, 15,000 less than in October, 1907, and 7,000 less than in February,
1907. We are doing all the things that we consider necessary
for the safe operation of the trains, and for the proper maintenance
of the property, but conditions so far have not seemed to
us to justify a resumption of the policy of betterments and extension
followed during 1906 and the preceding years. I do not know
absolutely that it is so, but I imagine that the other Railroad Companies
have been pursuing much the same course as we have here.
The latest reports indicate that the total railroad mileage of the
United States is about 230,000, so that the Burlington's mileage is
about one-twenty-fifth of the whole, and if you multiply what has
happened on this road by twenty-five, you will get a result for the
whole country which will probably not be far from the truth. In
fact the Eastern roads suffered much more from the actual business
depression than we did in the West.</p>

<p>It has been stated by men who should be competent judges that
from one-third to one-half of all manufactured steel and iron is used
either directly or indirectly by the railroads, and that fully one-half
of all the lumber manufactured is so used. When it became necessary
for the railroads to stop buying new cars and engines, and also
to stop all new construction and improvements, when possible to do
so, you can well understand the effect that that course must have
had upon the two particular lines of business just mentioned. Of
course, many other lines were similarly affected, and it would seem
logical that no full and real resumption of business can be expected
until the railroads are again able to resume the policy which they
were forced to abandon early in 1907.</p>

<p>When will that time come? I do not know. What will bring it
about? I do not know that either, but I do know what will help
matters greatly, at least so far as the Burlington Company is concerned;
but before saying what I have in mind in that connection, I
will digress a little, and briefly explain something of the financial
responsibilities of a large Railroad Company, because in spite of all
we hear about corrupt management, stock watering, etc., it is still a
fact that the railroads did cost something, and the money that was
used for that purpose was all, or very nearly all, furnished by private
persons like yourselves, and it was furnished by them for
investment because they thought or hoped such an investment would
be profitable to them, for there is, there can be no other reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
investing money in anything, unless it be invested for charitable
purposes. The Burlington System today, as I have said, is over
9,000 miles in length. It has large terminals in Chicago, St. Louis,
Kansas City, and the other great cities it reaches. It owns 1,600
locomotives, 1,200 passenger cars, and 52,000 freight cars. The
last annual report shows that its bonded debt (or the size of its
mortgage) amounts in round numbers to $165,000,000.00, equal to
about $18,000.00 a mile. This mortgage is legally entitled to interest
at the average rate of 4.185 per cent per annum, because it is
so specified in the bond, and that interest must be paid, or the mortgage
would be foreclosed just as would happen if you failed to pay
the interest on a mortgage, in case you happened to have one on
your home. In addition to the bonded debt above referred to,
there is outstanding $110,000,000.00 of stock in round figures, or
about $12,000.00 a mile, making a total capitalization of $30,000.00
per mile. We are constantly told that the American railroads are
overcapitalized, and yet the Burlington Road could not be replaced
today for twice its capitalization. I doubt if it could be duplicated
for three times its outstanding capital. The stock, as you know,
receives as interest or dividends whatever sum the Directors may
decide to pay, out of what is left after paying the operating expenses,
taxes, and interest on the mortgage. If there is nothing left after
paying the other items mentioned above, the stockholders receive
nothing, so that there is a certain risk connected with an investment
in railroad stock that does not apply to railway or Government
bonds. For a number of years the Burlington Company has
paid 8 per cent dividends to its stockholders. It has earned more
than that, as the annual reports show, and the Directors might
legally and properly have paid larger dividends, but they did not,
and all the money earned in excess of 8 per cent on the stock has
been spent for betterments, new equipment, etc. This policy, pursued
through a long period of years, as it has been, explains how it
is that the Burlington is in such good physical condition as it is
today, and with such a low capitalization. With this explanation,
you will understand, I am sure, that with an increase per year in
wages alone of $3,000,000.00, together with other increases due to
legislation, such as $325,000.00 per year because of the nine-hour
law for operators, and a smaller income because of rates reduced
(freight and passenger) in many states, the surplus, if any, after
paying dividends would be much less than formerly, and if any new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
work was undertaken it would be necessary to keep its cost within
such surplus as might be available, or else borrow the money with
which to pay for such work. I hope I have now made clear why it
was that we became worried about the Budget in January, 1907,
and why for the last two years we have been trying, so to speak,
to get our house in order. It will perhaps be said that we could
have borrowed money for new extensions, betterments, etc., and that
is actually what we were compelled to do, in order to complete the
Budget plans above referred to; but what prudent man would want
to borrow beyond his forced necessities, at a time when the future
seemed so uncertain, and when the interest on the money so borrowed
would add that much more to his existing burdens? The
same sound principles should and do underlie railroad operations that
you should and do apply to your own personal affairs. The items
are larger in the case of the railroad&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>I will now repeat the question&mdash;What will bring about a resumption
of business on railroads? And if I have succeeded in making
clear what I sought to explain, I think you can answer the question
just as well as 1 can, but I will give you my views, and you
will now be in position to judge whether they seem sound or otherwise.</p>

<p>In my opinion, railroad business, which really means all business,
will recover its former proportions when the influences and
forces at work during the last two or three years shall have ceased
doing the things that have contributed so largely towards bringing
about the depression which we all deplore. Perhaps that is not
quite clear. I do not mean that laws already made must necessarily
be unmade, that wages raised must be reduced, but we must have a
rest. We must be given time and opportunity to work out the new
problems that have been forced upon us during the last two years.
We must be given a chance to find out what it is going to cost to
meet the new requirements, and also how much our revenues are
going to be reduced by reduction of rates. Perhaps it will be found
that by new methods growing out of the exigencies of the case we
will still be able to earn a surplus sufficient to justify the resumption
of extraordinary expenditures as formerly. If not, then, either
rates must be advanced, or wages be reduced, or improvements must
wait or be carried on with borrowed money and railroads will be
slow to increase their interest-bearing debt under such circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>As I have said, two years ago during the legislative period, 800
bills affecting railroads were introduced in states reached by the
Burlington System, including those proposed at Washington. So
far this season, 272 such bills have been presented. It is too early
now to venture even a guess as to how many of them will become
laws, but until we know just what to expect, you can clearly see, I
am sure, that we will not feel like incurring any new or unnecessary
obligations.</p>

<p>Among the bills so far introduced are two in Illinois, called the
full-crew bills. These two bills, if passed, will increase the cost of
operation on the Burlington Road alone $96,000.00 a year, on basis
of present business. In Nebraska a similar bill is under consideration.
It is true that the two Illinois bills if they become laws will
not necessarily make our operations in Illinois unprofitable, but that
class of legislation will do much to discourage new developments,
by making such developments more difficult, or rather, less profitable;
and besides, in my opinion, such laws are not necessary.</p>

<p>As Burlington employes, you may be interested in what I am now
going to tell you about the development of the coal business north
through Galesburg. I need not tell you how much it has increased
during the last four years, for you have seen it grow from practically
nothing up to its present proportions. Some six or seven years
ago the Burlington officers gave careful consideration to the problem
of increasing the Company's business, and you must bear in
mind that freight shipments do not just <em>happen</em> to go this way or
that. Well, they finally decided that the most promising opening
was to try and develop a coal movement from Southern Illinois to
the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, and the Northwest generally,
where the winters are severe and fuel supply limited. It was found
that if coal from Illinois was taken to the Twin Cities it would have
to be sold in competition with coal from Pennsylvania and other
eastern states shipped by water to Duluth. It was also found that
the coal from Franklin and Williamson Counties in the southern
part of the state, while of very good quality, would not bring the
same price on the market in St. Paul as the eastern coal. It was
also found that in order to be sold at a sufficient profit to the dealer,
in competition with the eastern coal, the railroad would have to
carry it from Herrin, Ill., to St. Paul, 648 miles, for not more than
$2.10 per ton, or 3.2 mills per ton mile. It was also found that it
was impossible to do this at a profit to the railroad, as conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
then were; that is to say, we could not haul coal at that rate and
make money on a road full of one per cent grades. The engineers
were put to work, however, and an estimate was prepared showing
what it would cost to put the line from Savanna to Herrin all to a
standard grade not exceeding sixteen feet per mile, the line above
Savanna being all right. It was believed that it would pay to make
the improvement&mdash;and you know the rest. The line was built from
Centralia to Herrin, the Fenton-Thompson cut-off was built, grades
were cut, and, altogether, more than $5,000,000 were spent to put
the road in shape to haul coal to St. Paul in 3,000-ton trains. Of
course, many new engines were bought, as well as new and high
capacity cars suitable for the coal trade. It is a low rate business,
and as you know, the cars as a rule return empty, but handled over
low grades and in full trains it pays a fair profit; but every additional
item of cost, of course, reduces the profit.</p>

<p>Now to show the effect of proposed legislation. In Nebraska a
bill has been introduced placing the limit of cars that can be legally
handled in one train at fifty. If this bill becomes a law, how long
will it be before somebody will want a similar one in Illinois, and if
you are going to fix a limit so as to make it necessary to run more
trains, and consequently employ more men, and that is the undoubted
purpose of the bill, how long will it be before the limit will be
reduced to forty, or even twenty-five? Where will the thing end,
and when? With the mere possibility of such legislation looming
up in the future, can you expect improvements such as I have just
described to continue? Would you recommend them if in my
place?</p>

<p>How long will such legislation find favor in our halls of Congress?
Just as long as your representatives think you want it&mdash;by
you I mean the majority of their constituents&mdash;and no longer. Your
representatives and senators are human. They seek to obtain political
preferment at the polls, and desire to remain in office. They
must have a majority of the votes to be elected, and naturally they
will shape their course so as to meet your wishes, as they understand
them, because by so doing they hope to retain your support.</p>

<p>No one today questions the right of the properly constituted authorities
to supervise the railroads. No one defends the rebate, or
discrimination of any kind, but, as the Supreme Court of the United
States has recently well said, "<em>It must be remembered that railroads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
are the private property of their owners; that, while from the public
character of the work in which they are engaged, the public has
the power to prescribe rules for securing faithful and efficient service
and equality between shippers and communities, yet in no proper
sense is the public a general manager</em>."</p>

<p>No doubt there may be much in connection with railway management
in the past (and for that matter at the present time as well)
to criticise; but please tell me what line of human undertaking
since the world began, be it industrial, educational or religious, has
been free from criticism; and, granting all that is said against the
railroads, then what? This is what we find: That the railroad rates
in this country are the lowest in the world, with few minor exceptions
not worth considering; that the wages paid railroad employes
in the United States are higher than anywhere else in the world,
and that the capitalization of American railroads per mile, as reported
by the Interstate Commerce Commission, is but one-fourth as
much as that of English railroads, and one-half that of the railroads
of Germany and France, and one-third that of Belgium; and this has
all been accomplished in a country where a high protective tariff
obtains, and where everything the railroad uses costs more on that
account. It is claimed that our manufacturers must have the protection
of a high tariff in order to enable them to meet the prices
of their foreign competitors and pay American wages; but the
American railroad sells its product, that is, transportation, for less
than any other nation and still pays higher wages. A locomotive
engineer, for instance, receives $4.01 per day here as against $1.62
per day in England, and $1.01 per day in Belgium.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that railroads have received great help
from the people in the shape of land grants, and on that account
should give much in return. Let me give one instance of how this
has worked with the Burlington Company. In order to induce the
original projectors of this line to extend the road through Iowa,
this Company was given 359,000 acres of government land in that
state, selling at that time at $1.25 per acre, amounting to less than
$450,000 cash value. By an act of Congress, passed over thirty-two
years ago, a reduction is made of 20 per cent from the mail pay
on all land grant roads. At the present time the amount so deducted
from the Burlington, because of the Iowa grant, amounts to over
$65,000 a year, and since the law was passed has amounted in the
aggregate to over $1,500,000, or more than three times the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
value of the entire grant. Not only that, but it goes on without end.
Do you think that is fair?</p>

<p>We do not ask for favors. We wish to be treated fairly; that is
all. No one can possibly be more interested in the prosperity of
the railroads than the railroad employes. From every dollar earned
by the railroad forty-two cents go directly to pay wages of railway
employes, while only twenty-one cents, or one-half that amount, go
to pay interest and dividends. In no other country in the world does
the railroad employe get so large a share and the security holder so
little. Why should not the man who invests his money in railroad
stock receive as much return in shape of dividends as the man who
invests his in a farm or factory? The last census report of the government,
that for 1900, showed that money invested in farm lands
in the United States earned an average return of over 10 per cent,
and money invested in manufactures earned over 19 per cent. The
governor of Iowa, in a printed article over his own signature, appearing
in the February, 1907, number of "Farming," gave a number
of specific instances where money invested in farm lands in Iowa
earned from 18 to 23 per cent, and he referred to such cases as
typical. The last report of the Interstate Commerce Commission
shows total earnings of all railroads in the United States for year
ending June 30, 1907, to have been $2,589,105,578. It also shows
total capitalization as $13,053,974,156, and money paid as interest
and dividends $551,128,713, equal to 4.2 per cent on capitalization.
Certainly this does not seem excessive when compared with profits
in farming and manufacturing as given above.</p>

<p>We are glad to know that our farmers and manufacturers are
prosperous, because we have long since learned that when they are
not prosperous the railroads cannot prosper. I fear they have not
yet fully realized that it is better for them, also, that the railroads
should prosper. We hear no complaints in Congress or elsewhere
because our farmers and manufacturers are prosperous; in fact, we
are all inclined to boast about it.</p>

<p>The last annual report of the Interstate Commerce Commission
gives the aggregate capitalization of the railroads in the United
States as over $13,000,000,000, showing that the railroad investment
in our country is second in amount only to that in agriculture. It is
estimated that the number of railroad stockholders today is over
400,000. We know that in 1907 over 1,600,000 men were employed
on American railroads. Do you know of any good reason why this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
army of railroad men, together with the 400,000 stockholders, should
not receive as fair consideration from government and people at
large as the farmer and manufacturer receive? And yet the government
in effect lets the one have money without interest to buy his
land, and by means of a tariff makes you pay more for much that
you buy, so that the other can pay his employes good wages. Personally
I make no complaint because of either of these things; but
so far as I can learn no one in Congress has suggested that railroads
should raise their rates so that you might receive higher wages, and
yet the two things, rates and wages, are very closely related.</p>

<p>If anything I have said has helped you to a better understanding
of the railroad problem, I am glad. If it has caused you to take a
renewed or deeper interest in the subject, I am glad. I could go on
and multiply cases in confirmation of what I have said had I the
time, but what I have said already is perhaps sufficient. Do you
intend to make railroading your life business? Are you interested
in the prosperity of railroads, and particularly of the Burlington?
Do you clearly see the relation between rates and wages? Do you
think wages are too high? If not, perhaps you do not agree with
one of your congressmen in Washington, who has just recently, on
the floor of the house, urged that the Interstate Commerce Commission
be given more power over rates, which means power to reduce
them still more, because they have never, so far as I have heard,
exercised their power over rates in any other way. Personally, I
am glad I can claim to be a railroad man, and not only glad, but
proud of it as well. I think the American railway is the one great
institution above all others that Americans should be proud of.</p>

<p>Mr. W. R. Lawson, an Englishman, who investigated our railroads
in 1903, wrote upon his return, in his book on American Industrial
Problems: "The science of transportation is going to be the special
contribution of the American people to political economy."</p>

<p>Mr. Neville Priestley, an English gentleman and Under Secretary
to the Government of India, Railway Department, came to this country
in 1904 for the purpose of investigating our American railroads.
His report was submitted to the English government and printed.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
Among other things he said: "American railway men are quick to
see a new idea. They are quicker still to try it. They take a great
pride in their profession and are striving to get at the science of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>That their methods are not always perfect is what might have been
expected, but they have managed to do what no other country in the
world has done, and that is, carry their goods traffic profitably at
extraordinarily low rates, notwithstanding the fact that they pay
more for their labor than any other country. It is in the study of
how they do this that much benefit can be derived by other countries."</p>

<p>Mr. Leroy Beaulieu, a distinguished French economist, who visited
this country in 1905 and made a careful examination of American
economic conditions, wrote as follows upon his return to his native
country: "All in all, the prosperity of the American railway system
as well as the excellence of service it renders, is undeniable. If,
therefore, one were in search of model railway methods, it would
be wise to turn to those practiced under the free American system,
not to those illustrated by a system operated under the debilitating
control of the state."</p>

<p>It has been well said that "a prophet is not without honor save in
his own country and in his own house."</p>

<p class="pfs80">PRESIDENT OF THE COLORADO &amp; SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY.</p>

<p class="center">An Address to the Western Society of Engineers at their Annual
Dinner, Chicago, Jan. 5, 1909.</p>


<p class="p1" />
<p class="noindent"><em>Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Society</em>:</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to deal with any technical phase of the railroad
industry, and in saying this I am emboldened by a declaration which
I find in the Constitution of your society, to-wit:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This Society shall neither endorse nor recommend any individual or any
specific or engineering production, but the opinion of the Society may be

<p>The American railroad administration of today has abundantly
demonstrated its ability to solve all engineering and mechanical
problems, and we may rely upon it that the same American enterprise
and valor which have gridironed the continent with shining
bands of steel will solve any technical problem that may be ahead
of us for which money may be had.</p>

<p>I therefore proceed at once to engage your thought for a few
minutes, if I may, upon what seems to me to be the great problem
of the American railroad situation of today; that is, how to satisfactorily
settle the relations between private capital and the users
of the railroads.</p>


<p class="pfs80">FOUR YEARS' RETROSPECT.</p>

<p>During the last four years the American railroad has been in a
seething cauldron of publicity; a good deal of refuse has risen to
the surface and has needed to be skimmed off,&mdash;but I think I do
not violate any confidence in saying that not all of it has come from
the body of the railroad. Part of it seems to consist of political
bacteria and defunct statutes which attempted to violate the voice
of the people,&mdash;the Constitution which legislators had sworn to support.
And in this connection, perhaps I ought, in passing, to say a
word which has rarely been spoken in defense of the railroads, by
pointing out the shame of putting them to the great cost of proving
in the courts the unconstitutionality of statutes which ought never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to have been enacted because they were never valid. In the last
four years there has been much noise; the air has been filled with
shouts and cries, and more or less dust. Hysteria and virtue, although
really not at all alike, became confused, and a very large
percentage of the public absorbed the idea that the railroad highways
are public property, forgetting that all of us are absolutely
dependent upon private capital for the American railroad of today.
Again, we seem to have been upon a storm-tossed ocean. Fortunate
are we that through it all has run the Gulf Stream of our wonderful
American resources. If it were not for that, we should all have
been ruined. We have survived, but the pity of it is to think how
much better off we might be, if "We, the People of the United
States," would, in financial legislation, railroad regulation and other
matters, only exercise our wisdom as much as we do our power.
Legislation has been restrictive, not constructive. There is very
little in it, thus far, to help the railroad. Nearly everything seems
to have been thought of, except provision for money or for improving
credit so as to command cheap money. The country has been
flooded with conflicting laws and still the cry goes up for more
bureaucratic power and more statutes. It reminds me of an immigration
meeting in Mississippi:</p>

<p>The court-house was filled with an assemblage of white people,
and when the meeting adjourned an old darkey asked one of the
gentlemen who came out of the court-house what the meeting was
for. The reply was that it was an immigration meeting. "What is
dat?" asked the darkey, to which the gentleman responded, "We
want to get more white people from the North and East to settle
here." Whereupon the darkey said, "Foh de Lawd's sake, Majah,
dars moh white people in dis county now dan us niggahs can
support!"</p>

<p>I admit there have been many evils in railroad administration,
but I modestly affirm that there have been no more than in other
lines of business. The railroad industry of this country is young
and it acquired some children's diseases. Many people think the
railroads would have recovered from measles, mumps and whooping
cough without prescriptions from forty-seven varieties of doctors&mdash;forty-six
states plus the Federal government. It has seemed many
times that the railroad patient has been like the man who fell ill
in some mysterious way. The consulting surgeons determined that
an operation was necessary. They could not locate any definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
malady, but they found five hundred dollars on him so they operated
on him for that! Of one thing, however, we may be absolutely sure&mdash;that
is that the law of compensation is always at work. If we
have an excess of regulation, there is less of something else. It
is entirely probable that if there had been no political regulation of
railroads, the people of this country would have more roads, far
better and safer roads, and a greater distribution of wealth than
they have today. But I must not forget that, according to the
subject assigned me, we are here not to look backward, but to look
at the present, and then perhaps take a little look forward.</p>


<p class="pfs80">SOME CONTRADICTIONS.</p>

<p>From a mechanical and traffic standpoint the American railroad
of today is one of the wonders of the age. I give one illustration
only: Compare its splendid performance with a report I have here
of the Northeastern Railway of England, which has a large mineral
traffic. This report shows average contents of loaded freight cars
to be 5.72 tons, and average contents of freight trains to be 114.7
tons.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the American railroad situation in its political
and governmental relations is a bundle of contradictions. If you
were to engage your money in merchandising or manufacturing, you
would no doubt be appalled if you should discover that some one
entirely outside of your line of business could fix the prices at
which you must sell your product, and that the burden of proof
that the prices so fixed are confiscatory, is upon you,&mdash;and that you
could not abandon your operations. Yet this is precisely what may
happen if you invest your money in a railroad. The contradiction is
that there are no reciprocal assurances in your behalf. Neither
the State nor the Federal government will give you any financial
aid, nor will they guarantee you anything, nor will they even protect
you against competition, as France has long since been wise enough
to do.</p>

<p>A second contradiction is that although there was a four years'
war to prevent a division of this country, and although thereafter
our American genius connected up remote sections of our common
country, and although the work of the railroads has been splendidly
national, the attempt to regulate them has been lamentably local and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Lilliputian. I need only cite the conflicts between the enactments
and rate-making of different states and those of the federal government.
We hear more or less these days about the "twilight zone"
between the states on the one hand and the Federal government on
the other; but for those who administer the affairs of a great railroad
system, the phrase "twilight zone" is too polite a term. It is
instead a jungle in which the wayfaring railroad man may easily
lose his way, and possibly be actually devoured by "laws with teeth
in them." We hear a great deal about the simple desire that the
railroads shall obey the law; but who is wise enough to say what
the law is, when only yesterday the Supreme Court of the United
States left an important case unsettled, so far as it was concerned,
because it was divided four to four. These uncertain and conflicting
laws and changes in rates confuse the railroad manager more than
the public has ever realized.</p>

<p>A third contradiction is the attempt, by anti-trust laws, to maintain
the competitive idea alongside regulation, as if unrestricted
competition were compatible with compulsory uniformity in rates
and service. The President of the United States and other high
officials have spoken in no uncertain terms concerning the absurdity
of a situation like this, and yet thus far there is no relief.</p>

<p>A fourth contradiction is found in the great increase in cost of
producing transportation without the corresponding increases in selling
prices which have taken place in other kinds of business in which
private capital is engaged. The erroneous impression seems to
prevail that the supply of capital for the railroad industry is an
inexhaustible reservoir, regardless of the compensation which it shall
receive and the conditions under which it shall perform its work.</p>

<p>A fifth contradiction is the effort to connect up rate-making with
physical valuations. If it will be a satisfaction to the politicians to
have a physical valuation of all the railroads in the United States,
and the people are willing to be taxed to pay the great expense of
obtaining it, perhaps no great harm will be done; but I believe all
of us here would concede that valuations by the ablest engineers, if
separately made, would not agree, and that before such valuations
could be finished, they would be out of date. Some of us probably
think that for rate-making purposes the Government may as well
be employed in making a physical valuation of farms and farm
improvements in order to ascertain what is a fair price for wheat;
or, for that matter, perhaps be as well employed in adding up car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
numbers. I know something of a piece of railroad out west, which
in a great mining excitement was built through rocky and tortuous
gorges, and with four per cent grade hung upon the precipitous sides
of awful mountains in a climate described by one of the inhabitants
as consisting of three seasons&mdash;July, August and winter. Later the
boom evaporated and the business of the road got down to one train
a day. In the low ebb of traffic a brakeman one day "sifted" into
the trainmaster's office and asked for a job. The trainmaster put
him through the catechism, and among other things inquired, "What
would you think if you saw a train carrying green signals?" to which
the applicant promptly responded, "I'd think business was picking
up." Now, can any of us tell what they would do in Washington
with a physical valuation of a road like that? Its rates today are
only about one-fifth what they were at first.</p>

<p>A sixth contradiction is the wide-spread desire to regulate capitalization.
Now it may be that there have been abuses; but if one
asks any of these critics what is the grievance to be remedied, great
silence usually falls upon them, for they are unable to show any
more relation between rate-making and either physical valuation or
capitalization than there is between the price of a pair of suspenders
and the physical valuation or capitalization of a department store.
Railroads are continually importuned to make rates that will "move
the business," as in the case of the Western road just cited, and
those parts of the United States which have the highest railroad
capitalization have the lowest average freight rate. If you will look
at the <cite>American Review of Reviews</cite> for the month of June, 1908,
you will find a very interesting article by Interstate Commerce Commissioner
Lane on "Railroad Capitalization and Federal Regulation."
His program is a very simple one, and while pointing out that there
should be some way of insuring that the proceeds of all railroad
securities shall be actually invested in "acquisition of property, construction,
completion, extension, or improvement of facilities, the
improvement or maintenance of service and the discharge or lawful
refunding of obligations," he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Fundamentally, there is at present no inter-dependence of capitalization
and rate&mdash;the latter is not in law, nor in railroad policy, the child of the
former&mdash;though railroad men have sometimes expediently urged the claim,
and courts have sometimes too kindly given it their nod of sanction."</p></div>

<p>Also,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The most potent kind of regulation is that which casts the burden upon
the individual to do the regulating himself and makes him responsible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the law for dereliction; and the plan for the regulation of capitalization here
presented is founded upon that theory&mdash;to require the directors of the railroad
companies to make public announcement of their security issues, to
publish the objects for which such issues are made, and be responsible for
the use of the proceeds in the precise and limited manner announced. This
is far too modest a program to please those who delight in elaborate methods
of procedure involving much filing of forms and petitions and many hearings,
appraisements, viseings, and solemn givings of consent; and without
question it is not nearly as thoroughgoing a plan as others which have been
devised. But the simpler the plan is, the better, if it may effect its purpose."</p></div>

<p>He further says that his program</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"does not guarantee the prospective purchaser of the stock that the stock
certificate which bears a printed par value upon its face does in fact
represent property of the full value so designated; <em>but this is not a duty
which the Government for any reason is bound to assume</em>, and I know of
no motive arising out of national policy which compels the assumption of
such responsibility&mdash;certainly not at present."</p></div>

<p>If our complex government shall control all future issues of railroad
capitalization, we may rely upon it that most of the new railroad
construction in this country, instead of being independent, will be
fathered by existing railroad systems, because their established
credit, whatever it may be, will be required.</p>


<p class="pfs80">RECONCILIATION.</p>

<p>Is it not evident that these contradictions never can be reconciled
by untrained men? I believe that for the American railroad the time
has gone by when illiterate men will be put in charge of millions of
dollars' worth of machinery and other property. We are in a new
era. Railroading is rapidly coming to be a profession. We are
necessarily in all things doing more and more specializing. Why not
insist that the regulation also shall be in accordance with ethical
principles and not determined by political expediency?</p>

<p>The great over-shadowing problem of reconciling private capital
and the users of railroads, and the contradictions which I have mentioned,
are the inheritance of this generation of railroad men; and I
have no doubt that this generation, like all previous ones, will be
equal to the task put upon it. Out of the painful processes of the
last four years, we have emerged with some gains. In the first
place, the country now realizes that the one million, five hundred
thousand employes and officers of American railroads are not surpassed
in integrity by any other similar number of business men.
During the four years hardly a voice has been lifted to say this, and
so I am glad to have this opportunity to raise my own in their commendation.
In the second place, it is easier for shippers and railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
traffic men to be honest than it ever was before. The stoppage of
rebates is a distinct gain, morally as well as financially. In the third
place, it has been demonstrated, I think, that our Government <em>ought</em>
always to be bigger than any corporation, or any man, or any set of
men, and this is a good thing for us never to forget.</p>

<p>Already publicity has brought about a friendlier feeling between
the people and the railroads, and along certain paths I have no
doubt we shall find our way out of our difficulties, for the American
people are <em>not</em> unfair when they understand a situation.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion I was making a trip over a division of road
where there was no competition and where we therefore enjoyed
one hundred per cent of the business. There was an unexpected
stop for something and a brakeman went to the rear to protect the
train. Presently a wagon-load of girls came in sight. The brakeman
took out his handkerchief and initiated a flirtation. Then discovering
that I had seen the performance and evidently desiring to
square himself, he said without hesitation, "If we make friends of
these people they ride on our road." One could hardly convey better
than that brakeman did to me, an idea which we should never
abandon, namely, that one of the best assets a road can have is
friends, and I suggest that probably our first duty is to keep in
good humor and be considerate one for another. That involves and
includes good service to the public, and nothing will help more to
keep the public in good humor. The people of this country already
have the lowest rates and the highest wages in the world. They are
the best people in the world and are entitled to the best service in
everything. I believe they should insist upon having the best railroads,
and when they so insist, and realize that our population has
thus far doubled every thirty years and will soon be one hundred
million, and not very long after that one hundred and twenty-five
million, and that our transportation necessities double faster than
our population does, they will set about finding out what is necessary
to obtain adequate railroads, and then we shall probably hear less
about rates and more about efficiency and safety. When the people
do this they will soon discover that it is no more disgraceful to
make money in building railroads than in selling land or in merchandising
or in manufacturing or in mining. They will also discover
that although the courts have said railroad investors are
entitled to a reasonable return upon a fair value, no court&mdash;not even
that great tribunal, the Supreme Court of the United States&mdash;can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
finally say what is a reasonable return. This question would still
be unsettled because we have not yet gotten away from our dependence
upon private capital. What is a reasonable return must be
answered by the investor as well as by the commissions or the courts,
because it always takes two to make a bargain, and money, like its
human owners, will go where it has the best prospective reward
and the greatest liberty. The people will find that what we need
in this country is not more bureaucratic government by untrained
officials with brief tenures of political office, or more power to commissions,
but more responsibility upon boards of directors. If
statutes are necessary to insure this, well and good; but if regulation
is general in character and national in scope, is directed against
oppression and discrimination, and designed to promote safety and
efficiency and faithful accounting, the people will get better results
from intelligent and honest directors than they will from the best
governmental management which can be devised; and so long as the
railroads are owned by private investors, those investors will doubtless
insist upon their directors having more and more to do.</p>

<p>I am aware that there is a socialistic trend all over the world.
There is more and more disposition to prescribe medicine for other
people to take, but no amount of legislation will change the fundamental
laws of the universe. The fact is,&mdash;notwithstanding our
Declaration of Independence,&mdash;men are not created equal. It is a
fine thing for all of us that they are not. There is a diversity of
gifts; money-making is one of them, but a man may have the talent
for making money and be totally unable to build a bridge or paint a
portrait or lead an orchestra or an army, and if fortunes are acquired
under the laws which we ourselves have made, why should we be
envious? Unless a rich man hoards money like a miser, it is&mdash;if not
alarmed&mdash;continuously at work for all of us, through the banks or
otherwise, in spite of anything he can do, and the cheaper it can be
had, the greater the economy to society as a whole. It is impossible
to reduce everybody to a dead level, and how monotonous it
would be if we could! We don't satisfy everybody even in our
form of government, which we are prone to think is the best in the
world. For example, at the last election six and a half million people
did not get what they voted for. Part of them got what they
really wanted, but on the face of the returns, six and a half million
were disappointed, and yet the country goes happily on, apparently
to greater prosperity than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>But how much happier and how much more prosperous we might
be if there were not so much untrained meddling&mdash;if there were not
so many brakes upon the wheels of our progress! A brake, we all
admit, is a good thing in its place, but it has no <em>propulsive</em> power,
and the efforts of the time to combine in one man or in any one
body of men the four functions of prosecuting attorney, judge,
jury and executioner, must sooner or later give way. First, because
it is un-American, and where such a condition exists, as Alexander
Hamilton pointed out to the people of New York, "There is no
liberty." Second, because it will not work practically.</p>

<p>Reconciliation of private capital and the users of railroads might,
of course, be brought about by government ownership, because if
there were a deficit the people could pay it in their taxes. Even
then railroad rates could not be made mathematically consistent, for
government is never mathematically consistent. For example, if I
mail a letter to San Francisco or London, I pay two cents, and if
you mail a letter to Evanston you pay two cents. But nobody seems
to want government ownership, although many people contend that
that would be much fairer and more honest than governmental control
of railroads without financial responsibility. Perhaps a middle
ground may sometime be worked out by a profit-sharing arrangement,
as in Chicago between the city and the street railway companies.
That would have its advantages. Among the advantages
would be cheaper money for railroads, if the government would
guarantee a minimum return on agreed valuations. But of course
this would be much more complex than to work out an arrangement
with corporations like street railways, which do a single kind of
business at one rate, instead of a business affecting every commodity
of human consumption and stretching through forty-six states and
two territories. However, I think there is food for thought for all
of us in what has been accomplished here in Chicago, and the professional
intellect present tonight may well think it over.</p>

<p>Finally,&mdash;while a man has as good a right to increase his fortune
by investing in railroads as in any other manner, no matter what it
may be, I believe we shall find a solution for some of the puzzles
that beset us,&mdash;not through the gospel of tyranny on the one hand,
nor the gospel of equality on the other hand, but through a gospel
of stewardship. Let us all feel that although the acquisitive faculty
is undoubtedly planted in the human breast for some wise purpose,
we are not here primarily for personal aggrandizement. We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
here for service, and the greater our talents or our wealth or our
opportunities the greater our responsibility. We are trustees&mdash;for
the users of our railroads, for our employees, and for investors;
and let us welcome all the additional responsibility which may be
put upon us as directors or salaried officials. I am sure this sentiment
will commend itself to all of you, because there is no body of
men in the world which has a higher code of ethics and which has
demonstrated personal fidelity in a higher degree than the Engineers
of America.</p>

<p>Vastly the greater proportion of the commodities moved by
the railroads are in the processes of commerce; that is, the conveyance
from the place of consignment to place of receipt in
the majority of cases is sequent to a transfer of ownership. The
seller cannot continue in business unless he obtain a market for
his material, or his merchandise, and the purchaser can not continue
in business unless he secure the material, or the merchandise,
which he needs. The margin within which the added
charge for transportation may be adjusted is therefore limited
in one direction by the amount which the seller of a commodity
will accept and the purchaser will pay and continue in business.
If the seller or the purchaser cannot make a profit at least
approximately as great as from other operations in which it
might be feasible for him to engage he will, other things equal,
change his business, and the railroad will no longer have the
traffic that flowed from his operations. A railroad, therefore,
must adjust its transportation charges that production may continue.
This includes the adjustment of rates that products may
be sent to markets, that the products of the region tributary to
one railroad may reach markets in competition with similar
products of other regions, and in competition with other products
that will answer the same purpose.</p>

<p>The wider the markets that the producers can reach, the greater
is the encouragement to production. The more numerous and
varied the sources of supply of which the purchaser has choice,
the more likely that his requirements will be met to his satisfaction.
This is the case whether the sale or purchase be of food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
whether it be of raw material to feed the processes of mill or
factory, whether it be of wares for wholesale distribution, or
whether the purchase be of merchandise by the retail dealer, or the
final consumer.</p>

<p>It has long been claimed by the railroads of the United States
that their rates of freight are lower than those of any other country,
and that the nation's progress in industry and commerce has in
large measure been due to the cheapness and the efficiency of its
transportation service. By way of proof has been instanced the
proportion that the transportation charge bears to the selling price
of the staple commodities. It is said that the rate charged for the
transportation of food products does not affect their selling price
in any market of the United States&mdash;that price being fixed by the
processes of supply and demand which the amount of the freight
rate does not influence. In the spring of 1907 inquiry was made
upon this point among the produce dealers of the city of New York,
who gave the information contained in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>The price paid by the housekeeper per dozen for eggs during
the season of shipment seldom exceeds by more than five cents the
price received by the Western farmer who takes them to the country
store. That is, the railroads bring eggs a thousand miles to New
York for a cent or a cent and a half a dozen, and two thousand
miles or so for about two cents and a half a dozen, the dealers taking
the remainder of the five cents as payment for handling. The
net difference between the price paid per pound for butter at the
creamery, whether in New York City or in the Mississippi Valley,
and that paid by the New York retail dealer averages about one
and one-half cents for commission and one cent for freight.</p>

<p>In December, January and February turkeys are taken from the
Texas ranches to marketing centers, the transportation charge on
ten birds weighing one hundred and twenty pounds being about 25
cents. After these ten birds have been dressed and packed they
weigh about one hundred and two pounds, and the freight rate from
Texas to New York is $1.50 for 100 pounds. That is, a Texas
turkey that retails in the New York market for 20 cents a pound
will have paid one and three-fourths cents per pound to the railroads
that took it from the ranch to the concentration point and
thence to the market. The farmer in Texas received about nine
cents per pound, leaving a trifle over nine cents to be divided between
the packing house, the produce merchant and the retail dealer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Chickens and other dressed poultry that come from Chicago pay a
freight rate of about three-fourths of a cent a pound, the railroad
company supplying a refrigerator car, and keeping them iced while
in transit.</p>

<p>The rail rate from Chicago to New York on grain and grain
products for domestic consumption has been about 17½ cents per
100 pounds; that is, a bushel of oats or corn or wheat, that may
bring in New York anywhere from 40 cents to $1, has been brought
from the Western farm for from eight to fifteen cents. Hay that
has yielded the farmer $18 or $19 a ton and sells in New York at
about $24 has paid the railroads somewhere from $3 to $5 per ton,
according to whether it came from the meadows of the Ohio or the
Mississippi Valleys.</p>

<p>A bullock that weighs 1,200 pounds will, at Chicago, bring on
an average $5.50 per 100 pounds, which includes an average of five
cents per 100 pounds for freight from the grazing grounds. Its
total value at the stock yards, therefore, is $66. When it has passed
through the packing house its weight will have been reduced to
700 pounds. From Chicago to New York it will pay 45 cents per
100 pounds freight or, in other words, the 700-pound carcass, which,
if retailed at an average of 15 cents a pound would bring $105, has
paid the railroads between $3.50 and $4 from the far West to the
metropolis.</p>

<p>On potatoes the freight rate per barrel containing about two and
a half bushels is $1.05 from Florida, 65 cents from South Carolina,
45 cents from North Carolina, 30 cents from Virginia, and from
this 12 cents per bushel the rate scales down to five or six cents
per bushel from nearby regions. The freight rate on tomatoes from
Florida is 25 cents per package of six baskets, from Texas 15 cents
for twelve quarts, from Mississippi 76 cents per 100 pounds, and
from the nearby farms eight cents per bushel of twenty-eight quarts.
The freight rate on cantaloups to New York ranges from less than
a cent for a melon from the Carolinas to about two and a half cents
for that from California. Oranges from Florida to New York pay
the railroads from four to nine cents a dozen, and those from California
six to twelve cents a dozen, as they may be large or small.
A three-pound can of tomatoes from Maryland pays the railroad
about one-half cent per can.</p>

<p>The freight rates to New York on foodstuffs have been selected
as typical of the transportation charges applying on such commodi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>ties
in the main channels of traffic from the West to the East; and,
in so far as fruits and vegetables are concerned, from the South to
the East. The transportation charge per consumer's unit on these
foodstuffs is a trifle less to Philadelphia and adjacent Delaware and
New Jersey; another fraction lower to the great Pittsburg district,
and still lower to the cities of the West and South that are nearer
the places of production. As prices of food products fluctuate within
a fairly wide range and freight rates also fluctuate, though within
but a very narrow range, the rates and prices specified in the foregoing,
as well as in the succeeding paragraphs of this chapter, cannot
be considered as of specific application at any given time in the
future. They were exact at the time they were collated and will
very closely approximate accuracy at any period.</p>

<p>As New York may be considered representative of the places to
which edible products of the West and South are consigned, so also
may St. Louis be considered a typical center of reception of the
manufactured products of the East. The information given in the
immediately following paragraphs was obtained from merchants and
manufacturers of that city.</p>

<p>The transportation charge on the material entering into a pair
of shoes made in a St. Louis factory averages one and one-quarter
cents. The transportation charge required to place that pair of
shoes in the hands of a consumer in any part of the United States
averages between two and three cents. The material entering into
an ordinary bedstead, such as retails in St. Louis for $8, will have
paid the railroad about 40 cents. From ten pounds of nails made
in Pittsburg and retailed in St. Louis the railroad will have obtained
a trifle over two cents, and from ten pounds of wire two
and one-half cents. An axe made in the Pittsburg district that retails
in St. Louis for $1 will have paid the railroads one and one-fourth
cents. At Kansas City that same axe will have paid freight
of a fraction over four cents and at Denver, where the retail price
will have advanced to $1.30, it will have paid 14 cents freight. A
padlock retailing in St. Louis at 50 cents will have paid the railroads
a little more than one-half cent; at Kansas City it will have paid
one cent, and at Denver, where the retail price advances to 75 cents,
it will have paid two cents to the railroads. An eighteen-gallon
galvanized iron tub that retails in St. Louis at 80 cents will have
paid the railroad from place of manufacture two and three-tenths
cents; to Kansas City the freight rate will have been six and one-fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cents, and to Denver 15 cents, but here the retail price of
that tub is $1. A stove that weighs two hundred pounds and retails
in St. Louis for $18 will, in carload lots, pay 44 cents to Kansas
City or Omaha, and retail there for $22; $1.48 to Denver, and retail
there for $25; $2.50 to Seattle, and retail there for $30. When
a housewife of St. Louis buys a dozen clothespins she has paid the
railroad five ten thousandths of a cent. If she buys a washboard
at 50 cents she has paid the railroad forty-two one-hundredths of
a cent. In Denver she would pay for that washboard 60 cents, of
which the railroad would have received two cents. The higher rates
and prices that have been specified as applying in Kansas City and
Denver may also be taken as applicable to cities in the interior South
and Southwest, such as Oklahoma, Fort Worth and San Antonio.</p>

<p>In response to inquiries made concerning certain staple articles of
daily and general use in various of the smaller cities and towns extending
from Massachusetts to Georgia and Illinois, and from Michigan
to Mississippi, it has been ascertained that throughout this
region the transportation charge on such articles ranges as follows:
On a man's suit of clothes, from two to eight cents; on calicos and
ginghams, from one-fiftieth of a cent to one-fifth of a cent a yard;
the freight charge paid on the entire apparel of a fully dressed man
or woman in this section would range perhaps from six or seven
to 16 or 18 cents. The rate on an ordinary dining room suite consisting
of table, sideboard, six chairs and a china closet would average
from 75 cents to $5, on a parlor suite of sofa and four chairs
from 50 cents to $4, on a bedstead and its equipment from 75 cents
to $1.50, in each case from the factory to the home. The lumber
used in the ordinary eight-room house will have paid the railroads
from $35 to $150, and the brick from $6 or $8 to $50 or $60,
as the kiln may be near or remote. A fifty-pound sack of flour from
the mill, even at Minneapolis, in but a few cases has paid a freight
rate of over eight or nine cents to the consumer. Products of the
beef or the hog are carried from the western packing houses
throughout this territory at rates that vary from a fifth of a cent to
not exceeding a cent per pound.</p>

<p>It has not been difficult to secure such information as applies in
the main to the transportation charge borne by a manufactured article
from the place of making to the final market, or on foodstuff
from the place of growth to the place of sale to the consumer. Data
as to the amount of transportation charge carried by the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
kinds of raw material entering into a manufactured product has not
in many cases been so easy of ascertainment. A principal reason
has been that the manufacturers in numbers of instances do not
know what it is themselves. Many kinds of material are bought
at a price which includes delivery at the factory, the freight rate
not coming under the cognizance of the purchaser. The different
materials used in a product may have come from such diverse
sources, and paid such varying rates of freight, that the ascertainment
of the total freight charge in any given unit of manufacture
would be too difficult to be worth while. In numerous other cases
the freight charge is confessedly so small an item that no attempt
is made to apportion it as an item of expenditure per unit of product,
the total simply being grouped in the aggregate of expense.</p>

<p>The statement that the transportation charge borne by the material
entering into an ordinary pair of men's shoes averages one
and a quarter cents is the result of a definite calculation made by
one of the largest shoe manufacturers of the country. A leading
woolen manufacturer estimates that the price of wool at Boston
will average perhaps 30 cents a pound "in the grease," including
a transportation charge that will average one cent a pound. The
loss in cleaning and scouring is about forty-five per cent., and the
price of a pound of scoured wool will average about 63 cents at the
mill. Of this about two cents is chargeable to transportation. One
hundred pounds of wool will make about seventy pounds of straight
woolen cloth, on which the transportation charge has therefore been
a fraction less than three cents a pound. On cloth that is mixed
with cotton the transportation charge is less. The rates on woolen
goods from any of the New England mills are so low that a yard
of cloth which will sell from $1.50 upwards in any of the western
markets will not have paid the railroads more than five cents from
the sheep's back in Colorado to Massachusetts and back again to
the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>The following information as to the extent of the transportation
charge borne by divers materials of various industries has been obtained
in each instance from an authority in that industry.</p>

<p>The transportation charge on raw cotton to the mills in Massachusetts
will average from one-half to two-thirds of a cent a pound,
not exceeding one cent per pound even from plantations so remote
as those of Texas. Cotton loses from fifteen to twenty per cent. in
the cleaning, one hundred pounds of cotton making from eighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to eighty-five pounds of cotton goods. As ordinary calico will run
about six yards to the pound and sell for about five cents, the cotton
that has paid a freight rate of from 50 cents to $1 is woven into $24
worth of calico.</p>

<p>The transportation charge on a pair of rubber overshoes, including
the rubber from South America, the cotton stock, and the
shipment to the western markets, averages about two and one-half
per cent. of the cost of those markets. That is, a pair of rubber
overshoes retailing for 75 cents will have paid for transportation,
all told, less than one and nine-tenths cents.</p>

<p>In no one of these examples, which, perhaps, are typical of the
entire clothing industries in so far as the use of leather, wool and
cotton are concerned, is the transportation charge an appreciable
factor in the price either of the material to the manufacturer or
of the finished article to the consumer.</p>

<p>A barrel of flour made in Minneapolis and transported to Boston
is sold at the time of this writing by the milling company to a
dealer of that city, or any other place in New England, for $6.
Of that $6 accrues to the transportation agencies, for carrying the
wheat of which that flour was made from the Western farm to the
Minneapolis mill, and for carrying the flour from the mill to Boston,
an amount that averages 85 cents. The proportion of the transportation
charge to price at different markets varies with the freight
rate. At New York the milling company would sell that barrel for
$5.95, which would include a total transportation charge of 80 cents;
at Philadelphia the selling price would be $5.90, the transportation
charge 75 cents; at Buffalo or Pittsburg the selling price $5.80, and
the total transportation charge 65 cents; at Atlanta the price $6.20,
the transportation charge $1.05; at New Orleans the price $6.10,
the transportation charge 95 cents.</p>

<p>Typical rates on leaf tobacco, averaging in value $13 per 100
pounds from plantation to warehouse in Virginia and the Carolinas,
are from 15 cents to 21 cents per 100 pounds; on the smoking tobacco
into which this leaf is converted, and which sells at $48 per
100 pounds, from Richmond, Virginia, to New York City 30 cents,
to Chicago 59 cents, to Kansas City $1.16. Rates from the plantation
to the warehouse on the leaf tobacco of the Kentucky and
Tennessee region, which also brings an average of $13 per 100
pounds, are from 5 cents for short to 20 cents for longer distances.
The plug tobacco into which this leaf is converted is sold at $28<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
per 100 pounds, being distributed on such rates as these: St. Louis
to Louisville, 25½ cents; to New York City, 58½ cents; to Kansas
City, 35 cents; to Seattle, $2.20. Manufactured tobacco in all cases
is sold at a price which includes delivery from the factory to the
place of consignment, wherever it may be, in the United Stales.</p>

<p>The freight rate on cane sugar from the "central" in the Louisiana
district to the final refinery ranges from 5 to 10 cents per 100 pounds,
the refinery paying from $3.50 to $4.50 for the sugar. Sugar that
is sold by the refining company at 4½ to 5½ cents a pound retails
at 6 cents, the dealer making little or no profit. As a town of five
to ten thousand people at the average per capita consumption of
seventy-five pounds a year will consume a carload of sugar in about
a week, the jobbing of sugar is greatly decentralized. Contrasting
with this retail price of $6 per hundred pounds typical distributive
rates are, from New York to Chicago 25 cents, to St. Paul 30 cents,
to Kansas City 42 cents; from New Orleans to Chicago 25 cents,
to Atlanta 24 cents, to Kansas City 34 cents.</p>

<p>The freight charge on sugar beets raised in Colorado and Utah
from the farm to the refinery is always paid by the sugar company.
It averages from 30 to 40 cents per ton, or for a distance of fifty
miles is as much as 50 cents. A ton of beets contains about three
hundred pounds of sugar, which, allowing for an average loss during
extraction, would produce two hundred and forty pounds of
refined sugar. This is sent from the factories to the principal places
of storage&mdash;Kansas City, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Oamha'">Omaha</ins> and St. Louis. The aggregate
freight charge from the farm to St. Louis on these two hundred and
forty pounds is about $1.70, and the aggregate revenue to the refinery
at five cents a pound, $12.</p>

<p>While the price of bananas is subject to great fluctuation, a fair
average at New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Mobile
and New Orleans, the ports of import, is $1.75 per 100 pounds. The
average rail charge for carload lots from port to market is from 30
to 50 cents per 100 pounds. About one-third of the bananas consumed
in this country are received at the North Atlantic ports,
whence they are distributed throughout the Eastern and Middle
States. The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'remainding'">remaining</ins> two-thirds, which supply the South and
West, are received at the Southern ports. Immediately upon receipt
at New Orleans, for example, shipments are made to the North
in train loads that they may be taken out of the warm climate before
they spoil, and cars are re-consigned en route at the instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the company which has very thoroughly organized the banana
business, an allied company having about sixty agencies with men
who devote their entire time to extending the sale of the fruit.</p>

<p>For hides that pay a freight rate from the packing houses at Chicago
to New York of 30 cents per 100 pounds, the butcher receives,
according to quality, from $6 or $7 to $11 or $12 per 100 pounds.
The butchers remote from market have the freight rate deducted
from the price paid them for hides, but it is a trifle, seldom exceeding
five cents per 100 pounds. The hide loses from twenty-five
to thirty-five per cent. in the process of tanning; the price of
leather is fixed by measure and not by weight. The rate on tanned
leather, however, between Chicago and Boston is 39 cents per 100
pounds.</p>

<p>The railroads make low rates on fertilizer to encourage its use by
the farmers, it being, of course, to the interest of a railroad to encourage
the production of larger crops that its traffic may be augmented.
Fertilizer of different grades brings from $18 and $20 to
$55 and $60 a ton. Typical rail rates from the places of manufacture
are from Jersey City to Trenton, New Jersey, $1.10 per ton,
and from Boston to Portland $1.20 per ton&mdash;both rates applying in
carload lots. In the South, where fertilizer is extensively utilized,
representative rates are from Atlanta to Thomasville $2.50, from
Charleston to Columbia $2.00 per ton.</p>

<p>When allowance is made for the elimination of water from pulp
and the shrinkage in its manufacture into paper, the average freight
rate borne by the material entering into paper at the northern New
England mill is about 13½ cents per 100 pounds. The manufacturers
consider 17 cents per 100 pounds to be the average freight
rate on the paper from the mill to places north of the Ohio and east
of the Mississippi Rivers. The aggregate freight charge borne on
the average by the 100 pounds of paper which sells at the factory for
$2.50 is therefore 30 cents.</p>

<p>As with all things else, the rates on the ores of the far western
region have been adjusted under the necessity of the transportation
agencies to so serve the mines that their products may be
marketed. The rate upon the ore from the mine to the smelter,
upon the metal from the smelter to the refinery, and upon the refined
lead or refined copper from Chicago to the seaboard market,
are all determined by this prime factor. The freight charges, for example,
from the Coeur d'Alene district in northern Idaho on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
ores from which the extraneous material has been roughly separated,
to the Puget Sound refineries, reach a maximum of $6 per ton for
a distance of four or five hundred miles, and the rate from Puget
Sound to New York is $14.50, the average transportation charge,
therefore, being about $20 per ton. The value of a ton of copper
at 12 cents a pound is $240, and a ton of lead at four cents a pound
is $80. Copper passes through manifold and expensive processes and
its extensive consumption has followed the development of electricity.
Lead does not require so many or so expensive workings,
and it has long been a great staple of general use. The mine farther
from a smelter naturally has to pay a higher rate of freight than a
mine nearer to it, receiving, therefore, a lesser net price for its
product, <em>but the railroads are obliged to so adjust rates that practically
every mine can reach a market</em>.</p>

<p>The rate on refined petroleum between New York and Chicago
is 27½ cents per 100 pounds, the average rate paid north of the Ohio
and east of the Mississippi Rivers being from eight to ten cents per
100 pounds. From Toledo to Atlanta the rate is 48 cents, from
Whiting 46½ cents, from New Orleans 35 cents. The rate from
Chicago to the Missouri River is 22 cents, to St. Louis 10 cents;
while the rate from the Kansas field to St. Louis is 17 cents. One
hundred pounds of refined oil contain approximately sixteen gallons
which, at an average price of 12½ cents a gallon at the refinery,
would aggregate $2. The price per gallon to the consumer is increased
one cent with each increment of seven cents in the freight
charge.</p>

<p>The principal biscuit company receives from $8 to $16 per 100
pounds for its crackers and cakes, averaging $10 per 100 pounds
for its leading brand. From its New York plant to Boston the
freight rates are 19 cents per 100 pounds, to Atlanta 62 cents. The
rate from Chicago to Montgomery is 69 cents, to Houston 81 cents,
to Denver 97 cents. From either New York or Chicago to the
Pacific Coast the rate is $1.60. These rates apply to carload lots,
all goods being sold delivered, the company absorbing the freight.
The retail price is the same all over the United States as it is with
shoes, cigars, soap, proprietary medicines and dozens of other familiar
articles.</p>

<p>On cotton, the great staple product of the South, the freight rate
structure has been in process of development even a longer time
than that affecting the movement of grain from the West. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
plantation into Memphis, the largest inland cotton center of the
United States, a typical rate is 30 cents per 100 pounds for one
hundred and fifty miles. From Memphis to Boston the rate is 57½
cents, and from Memphis to the Gulf 30 cents per 100 pounds. From
Augusta, Ga., a central market of the Eastern cotton growing district,
the rate to Charleston and Savannah is 21 cents, to Brunswick 23
cents and to Norfolk 26 cents per 100 pounds. A bale of cotton contains
five hundred pounds and is therefore worth, at 11 cents a
pound, $55. The aggregate transportation charge on this bale from
the plantation, one hundred and fifty miles from Memphis, to Boston,
is $4.27.</p>

<p>Mainly because of the rapid shifting of the sources of supply,
there has not yet been developed a stable structure of rates for the
movement of lumber in all parts of the United States. By way
of illustration, however, it may be said that a fair average rate on
lumber into Memphis from the forests of Arkansas is six cents
per 100 pounds, or $2.40 per 1,000 feet. Lumber going from Memphis
to New Orleans for export will pay $4.80, or a total transportation
charge from the forest of $7.20 per 1,000 feet. A fair average
rate to the markets in Ohio and Indiana is $8 per 1,000 feet, a total
transportation charge from the forest of $10.40. This is on the
kind of lumber that in 1905 and 1906 sold at about $40. The
rate on yellow pine from New Orleans to Chicago is 24 cents per
100 pounds.</p>

<p>There is an equalization of rates on the iron ore from the upper
lakes in that the rates of the boat lines from the ore mines are the
same to each of the Lake Erie ports. From thence to the furnaces
they are adjusted under the policy of the railroads to make the
transportation charge on the raw material required to make a ton of
pig iron approximate the same amount at each of the competing furnaces
of southern Ohio, Pittsburg, Wheeling, in the Mahoning and
Shenango Valleys, and even as far as the Schuylkill Valley. How
closely this equalization is effected is shown by the fact that the
transportation charge on the ore, coke and limestone required to
produce one ton of pig-iron is as follows in these respective districts:
At the furnaces on the Monongahela River in the Pittsburg
district, $5.82; at the furnaces of the Mahoning and Shenango Valleys,
$5.57; at the furnaces of the Wheeling district, $5.78. These
charges compare favorably with those at the furnaces on the
Lake Shore in the Chicago district, which aggregate $5.63 per ton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of pig-iron, but are higher than at the furnaces on the Lake Shore
in the Cleveland district, where they aggregate but $4.72. The
rates on coal, which gives return loads to the cars that take the
ore south front the Lake Erie ports, are maintained at established
differences between the coal fields of Ohio, Pittsburg and West
Virginia. The rates in effect in the spring of 1908 were $1 per
ton from southern Ohio, 90 cents from southeastern Ohio, $1 per
ton from the Pittsburg field and $1.15 a ton from West Virginia.</p>

<p>The claim of the railroads that the rates on foodstuffs are not
high enough to enter as a factor in fixing the selling price is fully
substantiated by the statements of the dealers in such products.
That is, the conditions are, with negligible exceptions, such that if
the price obtainable in the markets be sufficient to encourage the
growing of livestock, grains, dairy products, fruits or vegetables,
the rate of freight, from whatever locality to whatever market, is
sufficiently low to allow the producer to enter that market. His
profits are, however, as a matter of course, diminished by the
amount of freight which he pays, and, as a rule, the farther the
place of production from the markets the greater is the freight
charge. The differences in the net return to the producer are almost
invariably reflected in the value of the land, which is lower
as the distance from the markets is greater. Largely because of
the defective system of mercantile distribution the grower of
foodstuffs obtains a smaller proportion of the price paid by the consumer
than accrues to the grower of any other agricultural product.
Where, as in this country, the opportunity for the extension of
cultivation is practically unlimited, a good market one season leads
the farmers of any district to increase their production up to the
point of minimum profit and the railroads are then besought for
lower rates; when unfavorable weather or other conditions reduce
their output they are also disgruntled. It therefore rarely happens
that the grower, especially of the quickly perishable foodstuffs, is
entirely satisfied with the freight rates.</p>

<p>A controversy, that it is scarcely an exaggeration to designate as
typical, occurred several years ago between the growers of watermelons
in a Southwestern State and the railroads conveying the
melons to the primary markets. In comparatively a few years that
region had become so productive that the shipments of watermelons
over one road alone ranged from 1,400 to 1,800 cars during
a watermelon season, deliveries being made all over Ohio and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Indiana through dealers from those States who came down and
bought the melons at the farms. The contention for lower rates
had waxed so warm that a reduction in the watermelon rate became
the issue upon which a legislative campaign was fought. The
candidate pledged to secure a reduction in the rate was elected,
and introduced a bill, which was enacted by the legislature, making
the rate to the nearest primary market 7½ cents per 100 pounds.
The railroad companies put this rate in effect and used it as a basis
for the lowering of rates to the territory beyond. During the year
of this rate reduction the traffic department of the railroad company
referred to sent word to the farmers that the company had
handled 1,500 cars of melons that season, the prompt shipment of
which had been highly satisfactory to the growers. It furthermore
said that the movement of these melons from that territory was a
one-way traffic entirely, it being necessary to send special cars
empty for the crop. These were necessarily stock cars that there
might be ample ventilation, but they had to be supplied with extra
slats in order that the melons might not fall out. It was necessary
for them to be switched in requisite number on side tracks especially
built adjoining the farms where the fruit was grown; that
switching engines be kept at work, putting cars in and taking cars
out all night and all day. The cars of melons, moreover, had to
be hauled on special trains at a high rate of speed to get them to
the markets before they spoiled. This reduced the tonnage per
train fifteen or twenty per cent below the maximum that could
be hauled at the normal freight train speed. A car with the average
allowable load of 1,100 watermelons would contain but about
twelve tons, although its capacity would be eighteen or twenty
tons; the weight of the car exceeded the weight of the load. The
switching and other special movements necessitated the employment
of night telegraph operators and other extra help at the melon
fields.</p>

<p>All of these conditions led the assistant to the general manager
of the company to make an analysis of the expenditure as compared
with the earnings. Waybills were abstracted and the receipts listed.
A tabulation was made of the revenue tonnage, the gross tonnage,
the tare weight, and the expenses incurred in behalf of the traffic.
He found that the handling of the 1,500 cars of watermelons involved
a loss to the company of $12,000 if the expenses of operation
alone were considered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The results of this investigation were brought to the attention
of the traffic department and the next spring it sent a circular to
the farmers in the truck region urging that the watermelon acreage
be reduced, as the rates on that business were not remunerative,
and stating that the railroad would not undertake to handle it except
in the regular cars that were brought into the territory in the ordinary
course of traffic; that there would be no special trains, nor
special service of any character. The melon growers at once notified
the State Railroad Commission, which, in turn, requested the
railroad company and the melon growers to attend a meeting to
discuss the whole subject. When the meeting convened the chairman
called upon the railroads to say why they had caused so much
trouble. The railroad representative, who was the aforesaid assistant
to the general manager, stated that as he had been invited to
attend the meeting it might be proper for whomsoever instigated
it to open the discussion. Several shippers made statements of their
complaints, all admitting, however, that the melon business had
become very profitable,&mdash;one grower saying that $300 to $500 per
car was being made out of a crop. The railroad representative
then made a reply, showing the loss to the company from handling
the business for the previous year, and stated that unless cost for
the handling and something by way of profit could be obtained, the
company would prefer to move other crops. He showed that it
had been necessary to park 350 to 400 especially prepared stock
cars in the melon territory; that it had taken a month or six weeks
to gather these cars, which had to be hauled empty to the melon
fields. He then pointed out that the rate per melon was less than
a cent and a quarter, whereas it had cost the farmer four or five
cents per melon to bring it by wagon the one or two or three miles
to the railroad track. The chairman objected to some of the
analyses, especially to the contrast of four or five cents per melon
for the wagon haul from the farm with the cent or a cent and a
half per melon for the railroad haul of two hundred miles. When
the railroad man had finished, farmers from all over the room began
to ask questions directly of him. They wanted to know how much
they should pay to afford the railroad some slight profit. They
were told 12 or 12½, cents. The chairman said: "The rate cannot
be changed. It has been fixed by law at 7½ cents and that is
the rate. I am here to protect the people of these counties." The
railroad man suggested that his company might be willing in addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>tion
to affix the necessary slats to the stock cars and perform the
switching for $5 to $6 per car. The farmers were willing to accept
this, but the chairman insisted that it was contrary to law, and
finally said in his wrath, "If you men here are going to deal with
the railroad company you can do it without me. This meeting is
adjourned."</p>

<p>With one exception the farmers remained in the hall and expressed
a willingness to pay a rate of 12 cents per 100 pounds.</p>

<p>Returning to the main discussion, we have found that the rates
on raw materials are so adjusted as to permit the manufacture of
any staple article at any logical place of manufacture. On the raw
material of wearing apparel the freight rate is entirely unimportant.
On the lumber that enters into building material, on the ore, coke,
and limestone used in the manufacture of iron and steel the freight
rate is sufficient to become an appreciable factor in the cost of manufacture.
On brick, coal and cement the selling price is the higher
by the amount of the freight charge, which for distances sometimes
not considerable exceeds the value of the commodity at the place of
production. The freight charge, even on those heavier commodities,
however, is far less in proportion to the wage of the day laborer
as well as to the incomes and salaries received in the United States
than in any other country. This is obviously a better test of comparison
than that based upon rates of freight as expressed in money.
To say that a specific rate is twenty cents in the United States, a
shilling in Great Britain, a franc in France, or a mark in Germany,
conveys an inadequate idea. When it is ascertained that the average
wage of the day laborer in the United States is higher in comparison
with the average rate of transportation than in any other country,
the comparison is significant. In this country a continually increasing
amount of railroad transportation can be purchased with the
wage of the day laborer. With the sum of money representing the
value of a given unit of any of the staple commodities of commerce,
also can a continually increasing amount of railroad transportation
be purchased.</p>

<p>That which makes possible the low freight rate of the American
railroads is the magnitude of the scale upon which the transportation
is conducted. The large cars, with a capacity of from thirty to fifty
tons, and the powerful locomotives that draw a score or more of
these loaded cars in one train, permit an almost infinitesimal freight
charge per pound or per yard that, however, yields by the carload<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
or by the trainload no inconsiderable revenue. For example, the
average weight of the carload of food products is about 30,000
pounds. If the freight on such a carload be $300 the rate per
pound would be only one cent, and there is scarcely a commodity
upon which a freight rate of one cent per pound makes any difference
in the retail price. As a matter of fact a carload of food products
does not bring to the railroad so much revenue as $300 unless it has
been moved from a far region; for instance, from the Dakotas or
Texas to New York. Specific complaint in regard to the freight
rates of the United States for many years has not, except in a
small minority of cases, been based on the ground that they have
prevented foodstuffs from finding a market, raw material from
reaching places of manufacture, or finished products from distribution.
While the difference of a cent or two in the rate of freight
may not in the least interfere with the conduct of industry or commerce
in the aggregate, such a slight difference, may perhaps determine
whether a manufacturer obtain his raw material from this
or that source of supply, whether a wholesale dealer obtain his stock
from the manufacturer in one, or the manufacturer in another city,
whether a retail dealer make his purchases from the wholesale
dealer in this city or in that city. That is, for example, the prices
of the products at the sources of supply being equal, a difference in
the rate of freight may determine whether Cleveland, Ohio, obtain
potatoes from Michigan or from upper New York; whether a factory
in Louisville obtain coal from the fields of southern Indiana
or central Kentucky. A carpenter in Des Moines may perhaps pay
a dollar for twenty pounds of nails without knowing or caring what
the freight rate may have been, or where they may have come from.
A difference, however, of a few cents a hundred pounds in the rate
of freight may have led the hardware dealer to have purchased
the nails in Chicago or St. Louis or even directly from Pittsburg.</p>

<p>As the purchase of raw material tends toward the prosperity of
the region where it is produced, as the operation of a factory tends
to the increase of population, to appreciation in the value of real
estate and the augmentation of business at the place of its location,
so also does the growth of a wholesale business or of a retail business
aid in the development of its surroundings. Producers, manufacturers,
wholesalers and retailers naturally all desire to extend their
sales, to reach further markets in competition with their rivals, and
are supported in this desire by the communities to whose welfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
they contribute. Any difference in freight rates that gives a producer
of raw material, a manufacturer, a wholesale distributer, or a retail
merchant an advantage over a competitor of another locality is
therefore promptly made the subject of complaint.</p>

<p>The pressure brought upon the railroads by such competing producers,
manufacturers and dealers has been a very important factor
in the development of certain arrangements of freight rates, which
we shall term the Regional Rate Structures, each of which has
grown out of the various characteristics of a traffic region and has
become adapted to those characteristics.</p>

<p>Other arrangements of freight rates which have grown out of the
needs entailed by the production and marketing of certain of the
principal articles entering into commerce we shall designate as the
Commodity Rate Structures.</p>

<p class="center smcap">The A. B. C. of the Matter.</p>

<p>"There has been much wild talk as to the extent of the over-capitalization
of our railroads. The census reports on the commercial
value of the railroads of the country, together with the reports
made to the Interstate Commerce Commission by the railroads
on their cost of construction, tend to show that, as a whole, the railroad
property of the country is worth as much as the securities
representing it, and that, in the consensus of opinion of investors,
the total value of stock and bonds is greater than their total face
value, notwithstanding the 'water' that has been injected in particular
places. The huge value of terminals, the immense expenditures in
recent years in double-tracking and improving grades, roadbeds and
structures, have brought the total investments to a point where the
opinion that the real value is greater than the face value is probably
true."</p>

<p class="center smcap">The X. Y. Z. of the Situation.</p>

<p>"An army of more than 1,500,000 men is employed directly in
the operation and maintenance of the railroads in the United States,
and millions of other men are furnished employment indirectly in
the mines, the forests and the factories, supplying the railroads with
approximately one and one-quarter billions of dollars' worth of
material and equipment annually consumed.</p>

<p>"These are wonderfully interesting and impressive facts; but the
fact of greater interest and worthy of the most careful thought of
every citizen of this country is that this vast army of men engaged
in producing the commodity of transportation at an average cost
more than <em>40 per cent lower</em> than is shown by any other country is
paid an average wage more than <em>50 per cent higher</em> than is paid in
any other country where railroads exist."</p>

<p class="center">LESSON I.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and the Clothes We Wear.</p>

<p>Whom have we here?</p>

<p>Eleven different types of American citizens, standing in a row,
clad in the varied uniforms or togs of their several occupations or
leisure from hod-carrier to the dude in dress suit and opera hat.</p>

<p>These men all live in the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>Their clothes were made in New England.</p>

<p>They paid the railroads <em>nine cents</em> apiece for transporting their
clothes, including shoes and hats, from the point of manufacture to
the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>The combined freight charges on <em>all</em> the clothes worn by the eleven
men in the group, including shoes and hats, was <em>less than one dollar</em>.</p>

<p>If freight rates were advanced 10 per cent the increased price
to these men on their entire wearing apparel would be <em>less than one
cent each</em>.</p>

<p>If they have to pay more than that per cent it will not be because
freight rates are advanced.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON II.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and Agricultural Implements.</p>

<p>Consider the McCormick harvester. It mows, gathers, binds and
stacks the bearded grain, while its proud possessor cracks his whip
above the backs of his three-horse team. It has banished the nightmare
of farm mortgages from the great prairies of the West.</p>

<p>This particular harvester we are considering is cutting grain one
hundred miles west of the Mississippi River. It was built in Chicago
and sold for $130.</p>

<p>The farmer paid $1.76 to have it brought to him from Chicago,
three hundred miles away.</p>

<p>If freight rates were advanced 10 per cent the cost of the harvester
would be increased <em>seventeen and one-half cents</em>.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON III.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and Cooking Utensils.</p>

<p>Next to the harvester the modern kitchen cooking range has
added more joys and years to the farmer's life than anything in
the cornucopia of modern civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is a standard range. It is a thing of beauty as well as a
means for cooking everything your mother used to cook and much
more.</p>

<p>The freight on a steel range, weighing from 400 to 500 pounds,
from Detroit to points in the Mississippi Valley, approximates from
$2 to $2.50 per stove on stoves which retail at from $55 to $60
each.</p>

<p>An increase of 10 per cent would add from twenty to <em>twenty-five
cents</em> to the cost of the stove, which, divided by the life of the stove,
taking the low average of ten years, would add one and one-half to
<em>two cents</em> per year to the cost.</p>

<p>On heating stoves the increase would be about <em>one-third less</em>.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON IV.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and Refrigerators.</p>

<p>What are the cold facts about refrigerators?</p>

<p>What cold storage is to the whole people, the modern refrigerator
is to the individual family.</p>

<p>It preserves all things sweet and clean and wholesome.</p>

<p>Now the freight on a refrigerator, such as is used by the ordinary
family, from Belding, Mich., where they are manufactured
in large quantities, to New York is approximately seventy-five
cents.</p>

<p>An increase of 10 per cent would add <em>seven and one-half cents</em>
to the cost of the refrigerator, delivered in New York City.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and Household Furniture.</p>

<p>Ever since Grand Rapids became the furniture hub of the Union
there has been no excuse for any American family being without
its antique or modern dining room set.</p>

<p>Look at this suite consisting of a solid table, six chairs, sideboard
and china closet, etc. It could be bought F. O. B. at Grand
Rapids for from $55 to $75, according to the wood and finish.</p>

<p>It weighs approximately 750 pounds and the freight from the
factory to Chicago would be $1.60.</p>

<p>An increase of 10 per cent would add <em>sixteen cents</em> to the cost
of all this furniture.</p>


<p class="p2" />

<p class="center">LESSON VI.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and a Business Suit.</p>

<p>Behold this business suit which no one would be ashamed to
wear.</p>

<p>It might cost anywhere from $10 up to $35, according to the
reputation of the tailor or the rent and advertising rates he pays.</p>

<p>The freight rate on such a suit of clothes, including hat and shoes,
for a distance of 300 miles from any of our large jobbing or distributing
centers is approximately <em>three and one-half cents</em>.</p>

<p>A 10 per cent increase would add a little more than <em>one-third of
one cent</em> to the cost of this suit, and it would add no more if it cost
$50 or $100.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON VII.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and "King Cotton."</p>

<p>"Befo' de wah" cotton was king. Of our exports it still leads
all our domestic products, having no second in sight.</p>

<p>If the entire cotton crop of the United States was compressed
into one bale its value would be about $750,000,000.</p>

<p>Of this bale in 1908 the railways got a little "jag" worth according
to the Interstate Commerce Commission $12,394,000, or less
than 2 per cent.</p>

<p>An advance of 10 per cent in rates on cotton could not add more
than one-fiftieth of a cent per pound to the price of cotton.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON VIII.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and a Sack of Flour.</p>

<p>Minneapolis, as all good little school children know, is the seat of
the flour industry of the United States.</p>

<p>If they do not learn this at school it is impressed upon their
receptive minds by every illuminated billboard and painted rock
that meets their gaze from Eastport to California.</p>

<p>There are half a dozen brands of flour ground at Minneapolis
and every one is better than all others.</p>

<p>The rate on this incomparable product in carloads from Minneapolis
to New York is 25 cents per hundred pounds.</p>

<p>That is 12½ cents per fifty-pound sack.</p>

<p>This flour is sold to the consumer in New York at approximately
$1.85 per fifty-pound sack (or it was when this was written).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>An increase of 10 per cent in freight rates would add but one
and one-quarter cents to the price of a fifty-pound sack, or a little
less than two one-hundredths of one cent per pound.</p>

<p>The freight rate on a fifty-pound sack of flour from Minneapolis
to Chicago is five cents per sack. An increase of 10 per cent in
rates would add only five mills per sack between these points, or
<em>one one-hundredth of one cent per pound</em>.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON IX.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and Dressed Beef.</p>

<p>The reason cattle are butchered and carried to the consumer as
dressed beef rather than driven to market on foot or hauled as
live stock, is that the freight charge is less and the beef arrives in
better condition.</p>

<p>Little children in New York and Boston appreciate this, if the
wise grown-ups of the West sometimes seem to doubt it.</p>

<p>The rate on dressed beef from Chicago to New York is forty-five
cents per hundred pounds. The average price of this beef
to the consumer in New York is (or was) approximately twenty-five
cents per pound. A 10 per cent increase in freight rates would
add <em>less than five one-hundredths of one cent per pound</em>.</p>

<p>If freight rates were advanced 10 per cent, the increased cost
in New York City of a two-rib roast of the best quality, weighing
eight pounds, retailing for $1.92, would be <em>less than one-half
cent</em>.</p>

<p>Surely this is not an excessive price to pay for <em>National prosperity
and industrial peace</em>.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON X.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight on Eggs, Butter and Poultry.</p>

<p>Eggs were cheaper when Columbus experimented with them than
they are now, but it cost more to carry a dozen eggs or a firkin
of butter ten miles in 1492 than it would to carry them 100 miles
now.</p>

<p>The rate on butter and eggs from points in Eastern Iowa to
New York&mdash;a distance of approximately 1,200 miles&mdash;is eighty-four
cents per hundred pounds. On dressed poultry from the
same points to New York the rate is ninety-six and one-half cents.</p>

<p>The eggs are sold to the consumer by the dozen and the other
commodities by the pound; <em>and the consumer pays every farthing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of freight that has accrued from the time the egg is laid, which he
buys in the "original package," or as dressed poultry, or from the
time the cow is milked, from which the butter is made</em>.</p>

<p>An increase of 10 per cent would add eight one-hundredths of
one cent per pound to the price the consumer pays for butter and
eggs, and it would add nine and one-half one-hundredths of one
per cent per pound to the cost of dressed poultry, for which he
pays from twenty to thirty cents per pound.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON XI.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Freight Rates and Leather Belting.</p>

<p>Some little children and many of their mothers do not know
that a great deal of the power that makes the wheels go round in
this industrial beehive is transmitted by belting.</p>

<p>The shops of the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Railway at
Elkhart, Indiana, are equipped with 13,288 running feet, or <em>practically
two and one-half miles</em>, of leather belting. This belting
cost the railroad company $6,235, or an average of 46.9 cents per
running foot. The belting was shipped from Boston to Elkhart,
a distance of 937 miles. The total freight charges amounted to
$18.37, or fourteen one-hundredths of one cent per running foot.
An increase of 10 per cent would add $1.83 to this cost, or <em>fourteen
one-thousandths of one cent per running foot</em>.</p>

<p>This belting, moreover, cost the railroad company $1,082 more
than it would have cost at the prices prevailing in 1899, representing
an increase of 21 per cent. During this same period there was
no change whatever in the freight rate.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<p class="center">LESSON XII.</p>

<p class="center smcap">The Railways and National Development.</p>

<p>Now listen to the sober words of the one man who has perhaps
given more official attention to the subject than any other citizen
of the republic:</p>

<p>"Without regard to the personnel of railroad officials, without
regard primarily to the interest of stockholders, but in the interest
of public welfare and national prosperity, we must permit railway
earnings to be adequate for railroad improvement at advantage and
profit.</p>

<p>"To my mind it is a most impressive fact, so great as to elude the
grasp of imagination, that the railway traffic of the country fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
doubled in the first seven years of this twentieth century. This
enormous addition to the volume of transportable goods overtaxed,
as you know, the existing facilities, and the resulting condition
perhaps accounts for much of the hostility which has been manifested
in various quarters. For the man who has raised something
by hard labor or made something with painstaking skill, which he
could sell at a handsome profit in an eager market, and finds that
he cannot get it carried to destination, and so sees his anticipated
gains turned into a positive loss, is naturally exasperated and unthinkingly
'blames it' on the railroads, and is ready to hit them
with anything he can lay his hands to; and as the state legislature
seemed to be the most convenient weapon he wielded it for all it
was worth.</p>

<p>"I dwell upon this a moment further, because it seems plain to
me that the prosperity of the country is measured and will be
measured by the ability of its railroads and waterways to transport
its increasing commerce. With a country of such vast extent
and limitless resources, with all the means of production developed
to a wonderful state of efficiency, the continued advancement of
this great people depends primarily upon such an increase of transportation
facilities as will provide prompt and safe movement everywhere
from producer to consumer; and that we shall not secure
unless the men who are relied upon to manage these great highways
of commerce have fitting opportunity, and the capital which is
required for their needful expansion is permitted to realize fairly
liberal returns."</p>

<p class="center smcap">Look Upon This Picture.</p>

<p>What is this I see?</p>

<p>Smokeless chimneys! Closed factories. Spiders' webs across
the doors of opportunity. Grass growing rankly in the streets of
industrial towns. Dejection on the face of nature and of man.</p>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<p>The railways have ceased to earn enough to meet expenses and
provide for the progressive maintenance of their equipment and
plant.</p>

<p>Why, are not their receipts greater than ever?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>True, but their expenses have increased more rapidly than their
earnings and their net revenues have only been maintained by
postponing purchases that must be made some time or the railways
will be incapable of performing their public service with safety,
dispatch and economy.</p>

<p>In 1908 and 1909 the railways scrimped maintenance $300,000,000
and this will have to be made good some time, some how, before
they are on as sound an operating basis as they were before the
panic of 1907.</p>

<p>What must be done to avert the consequences described above?</p>

<p>A readjustment of freight rates, involving a reasonable increase
applied to such articles and commodities as can stand it, without
any appreciable hardship either to manufacturer, merchant or consumer,
means the difference between grinding economy and a fair
degree of prosperity.</p>


<p class="center smcap">The Reverse of the Picture.</p>

<p>Would a 10 per cent increase in freight rates mean such a difference?</p>

<p>It most certainly would.</p>

<p>It would mean the difference between closed shops and suspended
improvements and the resumption of improvements with
the ability to resume the large purchases of material and equipment,
giving full employment to labor and furnishing improved
transportation facilities, which, within a very short time the commerce
of the country is going to demand more insistently than ever.
To hundreds of thousands of workingmen it means the difference
between steady, well-paid employment and walking the streets looking
in vain for work.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Narrow Margin Between Earnings and Expense.</p>

<p>"I have looked up the statement of about 80 per cent of the principal

the year 1907, after the tremendous increase in expenses had
become effective, while the gross earnings of the railroads increased
$57,413,078 over the same period of the preceding year, their expenses
increased $80,235,823, showing a net loss for the period,
despite the tremendous business handled, of $22,822,745.</p>

<p>In examining into the state of an art of such far-reaching importance
and such diversified nature as that of transportation by rail, it
seems necessary to acquaint ourselves with its beginnings and
growth; to determine the elements upon which its development relies
and the necessity which has invoked the various steps of improvement
in the plant devoted to transportation and the art of employing
and controlling it in the performance of a public service.</p>

<p>The lay observer will scarcely appreciate, in the absence of the
actual analysis, that there exists so many branches of this subject,
each branch of which, by itself, may be considered the object of a
separate professional science and a distinct human industry.</p>


<p class="pfs80">EARLY RAILROAD HISTORY.</p>

<p>Railways had their origin in tramways laid over 200 years ago in
the mineral districts of England, which conveyed coal to the sea.
Animal motive power was used. By the discovery, in 1814, of the
adhesion of a smooth wheel to a smooth rail, it became possible to
consider the employment of the tractive power of a rolling locomotive,
and for some time subsequent to this, to the trial trip of the
"Rocket," in 1829, which may be described as the first successful
steam locomotive, the experiments were along these lines.</p>

<p>While industrial railroads similar in character to the English
existed in this country, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio was the pioneer American
railroad built for public use. On July 4, 1828, the first rail was
laid by Charles Carroll, the only surviving signer of the Declaration
of Independence, and thirteen miles were opened for traffic in
1830. In the same year the West Point Foundry began building
locomotives, producing the "De Witt Clinton," in 1831. It weighed
three and one-half tons, and was built for the Mohawk &amp; Hudson
Railroad, the pioneer company of the present New York Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Lines, which had been chartered in 1826, four years before actual
construction was begun.</p>

<p>The line was opened from Albany to Schenectady in 1831; to
Utica in 1836, and to Buffalo in 1842. Connections to New York
and Boston were built in rapid succession.</p>

<p>About this time, in Pennsylvania, the Columbia Railroad was
built from Philadelphia to Columbia, on the Susquehanna River,
forming the pioneer division of the present Pennsylvania System.</p>

<p>Several companies were chartered about the same time in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Following the panic of 1837 there was little industrial development
and a lull in railroad construction, but with 1850 begins the
era of rapid extension and the welding of short connecting lines
under single ownerships. The consolidation was vigorously objected
to at first. Originally there were eleven companies owning and
operating the line between Albany and Buffalo. Between Buffalo
and Cleveland, changes of passengers and freight were made at Dunkirk
and Erie. The latter change was made necessary by the difference
in gauge; to the east six feet and to the west four feet ten
inches. Plans for the consolidation of some of these lines made in
1853 entailed for through operation the change of the gauge east to
conform to that west of Erie, to obviate transfer. This proposition
so aroused the inhabitants of Erie that they resorted to violence. In
December, 1853, they tore down the railroad bridge, no trains going
through until February, 1854. This same bridge was rebuilt in 1855,
but again torn down and burned by a mob. Finally a compromise
ended what is known as the Erie War and the gauge was changed,
from which time dates the beginning of definite through operation.</p>

<p>In 1851 the Erie Railroad joined New York with Lake Erie. The
Baltimore &amp; Ohio reached the Ohio River. Two years later the
Atlantic seaboard and Chicago were connected by rail, which the
following year reached the Mississippi River. These extensions to
the Western Frontier opened the traffic between the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers.</p>

<p>In the early days the public desire for rail transportation facilities
led to numerous enterprises securing public financial support, but
owing to the disaster that was experienced in some of these enterprises
the Ohio law prohibited any town, county or State from rendering
such assistance. When the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad was
built, Cincinnati found it imperative to have railroad communication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to the South, but the prohibition of the aforesaid law prevented public
assistance, and the scheme was devised of building and owning a
line. This line went south through Kentucky to Chattanooga, was
built and operated, and eventually leased to the Cincinnati, New
Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific.</p>

<p>The railroads played an important part in the conduct of the Civil
War, many of them being practically devoted to the transportation
of Government troops and supplies. Great damage was done to the
many lines in the South owing to the military operations. By the
close of the war there had been no pronounced advance in protection
by the appliances which are now commonly employed in the
control of train operation. This was largely due to the light equipment,
slow speeds and sparse traffic.</p>

<p>The first Pacific railroad was begun, with Government aid, in the
'60s. With the opening up of the West and the return to industrial
pursuits of the people after the close of the war dates a remarkable
era in railroad extension. In the decade from 1880 to 1890, 70,000
miles were built in the central and western districts, opening vast
unoccupied agricultural, grazing and mineral sections to immigration
and development. The panic of 1893 exerted considerable influence
on railroad construction during the following decade.</p>

<p>The period since 1900 has been more one of reconstruction and
improving existing lines; the growth of industries and population
tributary to existing lines necessitating this course.</p>

<p>The vastness of the railroad industry may be imagined when one
considers that from fifteen to twenty per cent of the capital of the
United States is invested in railroads. As an exhibit of the growth
and importance let me quote the following statistics of railroad
growth by decades since the first operation:</p>

<p>Such is the exhibit of progress in the extent of railroads, broadly
viewed. With the growth in extent the elements of safety have multiplied
and have become very numerous; in fact, an almost indefinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
subdivision of railroad property and operation in respect of safety
might be conceived. We will consider, however, the beginnings and
the growth of a few of the more important and striking items and
their relationship to the state of the art, as portraying in a more
graphic manner the adjustment, if you may call it such, of safety
to progress, or, as the subject has been assigned to me, "Progressive
Safety."</p>


<p class="pfs80">AIR BRAKES.</p>

<p>As the density of traffic, and the speed, together with the weight
of equipment, developed, following upon the greater transportation
to be undertaken, the question of brakes was an important factor.
More efficient brakes were needed; the essential characteristics being
that they should be continuous throughout the length of the
train, simultaneously applied and released, with a single point of
control.</p>

<p>In 1869 George Westinghouse, Jr., brought forth what is known
as the straight air brake, consisting of a pump, main reservoir, three-way
valve, brake cylinder and train line. Application was made by
admitting air from the main reservoir into the train line. The brakes
were released by reducing the train-line pressure into the atmosphere
through the three-way valve. The brakes were useless if there was
a leak, a burst in the air line or a parted train.</p>

<p>With these shortcomings in mind, the automatic air brake was
produced in 1873, in which the method was reversed. With the addition
of an auxiliary reservoir under each passenger car and a triple
valve, application of brakes was secured by reducing the train-line
pressure, while admitting air from the main reservoir raised the pressure
and released the brakes. On the application of the automatic
air brake to freight cars it was found the reduction of pressure
was not quick enough to set the rear brakes promptly, and in consequence
accidents occurred from the bunching of the cars.</p>

<p>The consideration of the brake question by the Master Car Builders'
Association in 1885, and public tests under their auspices in
1886, at which time the manufacturers were represented, did not
succeed in stopping freight trains without violent and disastrous
shocks. So discouraging did these tests seem for the time being,
that a report was made, suggesting that the successful application of
such brakes on long trains could only be accomplished by electricity.
However, the following January witnessed the introduction of the
Westinghouse Quick-Action air brake, which corrected the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
trouble and made practicable the application of air brakes to long
freight trains. Continuing from this time there has been marked
improvement and development in all features of the apparatus, without,
however, modifying the essential elements of which it is constituted.</p>

<p>With the solution of a means of train control came a further
growth in their size and weight; sooner or later this had to emphasize
the necessity for efficient coupling devices. Not only were there
accidents due to the primitive link and pin couplers, but the various
standards in existence both complicated the operations of coupling
and uncoupling of cars and involved the question of interchange and
safety.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AUTOMATIC COUPLERS.</p>

<p>Owing to the large number of accidents, Mr. F. D. Adams, of the
Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, recommended to the Master Car Builders'
Association, at its third convention, in 1869, that a uniform
height should be established for couplers; their failure to meet when
cars came together being considered the cause of numerous accidents.
In 1871 that convention adopted 33 inches as the standard
height for standard-gauge cars. At the convention of 1873 Mr. M.
N. Forney urged that a committee investigate the cause of accidents
and make recommendation. This committee in the following year
gave as the principal cause the same as reported by Mr. Adams eight
years before. They pronounced the tests of automatic couplers to
date a failure. Another committee at this same convention gave the
first recognition to automatic couplers by reporting that a great
advantage would be derived from a uniform drawbar, such as would
be accepted as a standard and which would be a self-coupler. During
several years following various models were examined, but nothing
was found to meet the demands. In 1877 Mr. John Kirby, of
the Lake Shore, reported that his company intended to equip 100
cars with self-couplers, and at the same meeting Mr. Garey, of the
New York Central, told of having been waited upon by a committee
of yardmasters, asking for dead blocks or some such safety device.
This turned the attention of the Association from the coupler to the
dead block. In the year following they invited the Yardmasters'
Association to act in concert with their committee in reporting upon
means of safety for protection of yard and train men in the performance
of their duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the situation when on March 19, 1880, the Massachusetts
Legislature instructed the Railroad Commission to investigate
and report with recommendation as to means of prevention of accidents
in the coupling of cars. They reported that they preferred
to be guided by the action of the railroad companies, and any device
made standard by them would, in their opinion, be the best recommendation
for such device.</p>

<p>In 1882 the Connecticut Railroad Commissioners recommended to
the Legislature that automatic couplers be required on all new cars.</p>

<p>In 1883 the Massachusetts Commissioners expressed the hope
that the Master Car Builders' Association would at its convention
agree upon some type of coupler for freight cars.</p>

<p>In 1884 the Association selected Mr. M. N. Forney to conduct
tests of automatic couplers and report. Attention was called at that
time to less than a dozen varieties that were worthy of consideration.
With this action of the Association as a guide, the Massachusetts
Commissioners undertook to solve the problem, and announced
that they would not prescribe any coupler that had not
been tested in actual traffic, but notified the railroad companies in
the State that all new cars, and cars requiring new couplers, should
be provided with one of five kinds specified. It happened that the
kinds specified would not couple with each other.</p>

<p>In 1885 public tests were held at Buffalo by Mr. Forney. Forty-two
couplers were tested, twelve of which were recommended for
further tests. In the following year the trials made of power brakes
on freight trains made it very evident that the link and pin type of
coupling would not suffice, and it was eliminated from further consideration.</p>

<p>In 1887 the Executive Committee reported in favor of the Janney
type of coupler and all other forms that would automatically couple
with it under all conditions of service. This report was adopted in
1888 by a vote of 474 for and 194 against. The Executive Committee
then undertook to establish contour lines, drawings and templates
as standard, but found that the Janney patents covered the contour
of vertical plane couplers. This was remedied in 1888, when the
Janney Coupler Company waived all claims for patents on contour
lines of coupling surfaces of car couplers used on railroads members
of the Master Car Builders' Association, which enabled the Association
to formally adopt in all respects this type of coupler as standard.
At the convention of 1889 such action was taken, on motion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Mr. Voorhees, General Superintendent of the New York Central
Railroad, and since that time this type of coupler has been the standard,
and called the "Master Car Builders' Coupler."</p>

<p>In 1893 Congress enacted a law requiring all railroads engaged
in interstate commerce to provide on all cars and locomotives a
continuous power brake capable of being controlled by the engineman
in the locomotive cab, and also automatic couplers which would
operate by impact. January 1, 1898, was the date set by which
these changes must be made&mdash;subsequently extended two years.
We now have uniformity in height and contour to insure perfect
contact between all classes of equipment, and a positively locked
knuckle. The design and attachments to car body are prescribed
of a strength in excess of the power of locomotives, and in modern
friction draft gear the strength reaches 250,000 pounds.</p>


<p class="pfs80">SIGNALING.</p>

<p>The need of indicating the conditions of the road to trains came
with the increasing traffic and speed. As these conditions developed
in England before they did here, the first steps were taken in
that country. In 1834 the Liverpool &amp; Manchester introduced the
first system of fixed signals, consisting of an upright post with a
rotating disk at its top, showing red for danger and the absence of
indication by day and a white light by night for clear. On the
opening of the Great Western Railway this method was improved.
Experiments by Messrs. Chappe, the inventors of optical telegraphy,
showed that under certain conditions of illumination the color of
any body would disappear. This demonstrated that the form, and
not the color, of the day signal could be relied on. It was also found
that a long, narrow surface could be seen further as projected
against the horizon or landscape than the same area in a square or
circle. Making use of these results, Sir Charles Gregory, in 1841,
designed and erected at New Cross the first semaphore signal.
There was no communication between stations; each signalman displaying
his signal at danger after the passage of a train until a
certain time had elapsed, when it was cleared. The only information
conveyed to the engineman was that the preceding train had
passed the station at least the required time before him.</p>

<p>The failure or inability to act with sufficient promptness at the
display of the danger position, and the consequent collisions, led
to the installation of additional signals to give advance information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to the engineman of the position of the signal he was to obey.
Thus we have clearly portrayed the inception of the present block
and caution signals.</p>

<p>Mr. C. V. Walker, of the Southwestern Company, introduced
the "Bell Code," which was the first audible method of communication
between signal stations. The same year Mr. Tyer supplemented
this with electric visual signals, the object being to give
the operator indication of the signal having been received and given,
and at all times to show the exact position of the signal itself. This
suggested the space interval between trains, in place of the time
interval, making signal indications definite. In 1858 the positive
block system was established in England, based on the space interval
system.</p>

<p>Making use of telegraph communication, Mr. Ashbel Welch,
Chief Engineer of the United New Jersey Canal and Railroad Company,
devised and installed during 1863 and 1864 the first block
system of signals in this country, on the double-track line between
Philadelphia and New Brunswick. Signal stations were suitably
spaced, and at each station a signal was provided, visible as far as
possible each way. The signal itself was a white board by day
and a white light by night, indicating "clear," shown through a
glass aperture two feet in diameter in front of the block signal
box. For the "danger" indication a red screen fell to cover the
white board or light. On a train's passing a station the signalman
released the screen, which fell by gravity, and did not raise it until
advised by telegraph that the preceding train had passed the next
station, thereby maintaining a space interval. Thus was evolved
the telegraph block system, still generally used, with modifications
of apparatus and signals, on lines of light traffic. Elaborations of
this system were later installed following more closely the English
practice, perhaps reaching the most complete development upon
the New Haven and New York Central lines, where it is still in use.
Notwithstanding numerous improvements in apparatus, the same
practice of fixing a positive space interval by means of communication
between block stations still holds. The addition of track circuits
for locking and indicating purposes and interlocking between
stations, more fully effected by the introduction of the "Coleman
block instrument," in 1896, has thus evolved the controlled manual
block system as now used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs80">AUTOMATIC SIGNALS.</p>

<p>In 1867 Thomas S. Hall patented an electric signal and alarm
bell, used in connection with a switch or drawbridge. Its shortcoming
lay in the fact that a break in the circuit or failure of the
latter gave no danger indication. To correct this a closed circuit
was necessary, although more expensive. In 1870 Mr. Wm. Robinson
devised the plan of having the circuit closed at the point of
danger, if conditions were favorable, and opened a short distance
in advance of the signal. The wheels of the approaching train
depressed a lever, which closed the circuit and cleared the signal,
unless interrupted at the point of danger. Subsequent modifications
were made, whereby the circuit once completed remained so
through the agency of an electromagnet, and reopened when the
train passed out of that portion of the track governed by the signal.</p>

<p>In 1871 Mr. Hall put in operation the first automatic electric
block system, on the New York &amp; Harlem Railroad, between the
Grand Central Station and Mott Haven Junction. It was normal
"safety." The wheels of a passing train striking a lever completed
a circuit, which put the signal to danger, after the train, and held
it so until the succeeding signal went to danger, when a separate
circuit was completed, which released the former signal, allowing
it to return to clear.</p>

<p>The disadvantage in having the wheels of a train strike a lever to
complete the circuit led Mr. F. L. Pope to experiment. After a
successful attempt in transmitting an electric circuit through an ordinary
track with fishplate joints, he made a signal test at East Cambridge,
Mass. A section of track was insulated from the rest, with
a wire circuit, including a battery and electromagnet for operating
the signal, fastened at either end to the opposite rails. The metal
wheels and axles completed the circuit, throwing the signal to danger
against following trains. A detent served to keep the circuit
closed until the next signal was reached, when a separate circuit
released the detent, permitting the signal to clear.</p>

<p>In 1879 this system was put in service, and, with some alterations,
still remains in some localities.</p>

<p>Following the original manual semaphore and the controlled manual
system of operation came the pneumatic and electric systems,
for localities which required a great number of signal movements.
With the development of motors and batteries capable of economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
operation, automatic signals of the semaphore type have been successfully
and widely installed.</p>

<p>In the semaphore system numerous failures have occurred, due to
the formation of ice and sleet upon the blades. This has led to
the introduction of the so-called "upper quadrant" operation; that
is, the motion of the signal being from horizontal to an upwardly
inclined position and back.</p>

<p>On account of the widespread prevalence of electric lighting and
the building up of the territory adjacent to railroads, changes in
the color indication of night signals have been adopted, generally in
such localities using green instead of white for the safety indication.</p>


<p class="pfs80">INTERLOCKING.</p>

<p>Developing with the manual operation of signals, and as a safeguard
against mistakes of the signalmen, interlocking grew up as a
means for preventing conflicting signals being given at the same
time. As with signals, so with interlocking, England led at first.
After a trip to that country in 1869, Mr. Ashbel Welch recommended
the advantage derived from the English method of operating
switches and signals in large yards and terminals, where the
entire control fell to one man so located as to be in touch with the
whole situation and equipped with a machine that would not permit
of setting up conflicting routes. The plea resulted in the order of a
twenty-lever Saxby &amp; Farmer interlocking machine, which was installed
in 1874 on the New Jersey Division of his line. Railroads
were prompt to see its advantage, and in a short time machines performing
the functions were made and installed in this country,
not only for the protection of railroad intersections, but for the control
of large terminal layouts. In 1876 the first power-operated
interlocking system was perfected, which was the pneumatic type.
In 1900 an all-electric interlocking system, advantageous where distant
functions were to be embraced within the operation of the
plant, and applicable to localities where electric traction was in use,
was devised.</p>

<p>The more recent development of power-operated interlocking
systems, with complete electric indication of the conditions on all
tracks, has made it possible for larger systems to be consolidated
under the control of a central plant, and thus under the direction of
a central authority; these machines, being of a completely interlocked
character, insure greater safety by the central control, as well
as greater facility of operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs80">TRAIN DISPATCHING.</p>

<p>In this country the first radical departure from the time interval
and flagging method of operation came in 1851. The New York &amp;
Erie Railroad had established a single line of telegraph between
Piermont, on the Hudson River, and Dunkirk, on Lake Erie, for
company business. The Superintendent of Telegraph, Mr. Luther
C. Tillottson, and the Division Superintendent were together in the
Elmira depot on an occasion and learned that the westbound express
from New York was four hours late. At Corning an eastbound
stock train and a westbound freight at Elmira waited for the express.
With this information, Mr. Tillottson suggested that the
freight train at Elmira could be sent to Corning and the stock train
at that point ordered to Elmira, with perfect safety, before the
arrival of the express. The move was successful and encouraged
similar operation, which shortly led to the adoption, with some
modifications, of this train-dispatching method on the Susquehanna
Division of the Erie. Its adoption over the entire line followed, in
spite of the great opposition which Mr. Charles Minot, the General
Superintendent, met when planning for its introduction. Some of
the conductors and enginemen went so far as to resign rather than
run on telegraphic orders against the time of another train.</p>

<p>This system spread rapidly to other lines and, in company with
other features of railroad operation, has been progressively developed
and improved. One of the important elements of safety in the
dispatching practice has been the tendency to the same words in
the same sequence to convey the same instructions, insuring a uniform
understanding of the instructions instead of permitting a discretionary
phraseology in originating or a misunderstanding in construing
the order transmitted. The rules for train dispatching now
prescribe the use of standard forms of expression for orders governing
the movement of trains.</p>

<p>Within the past few years experiments have been made with a system
of train dispatching by telephone, now in successful operation
upon some important lines, and growing in extent. Advantage lies
in the ability to use trained railroad employes who cannot work
under the telegraph system, not being telegraph operators. The
telephone-dispatching system not only insures a rapid distribution of
information, but by its greater capacity enables a more complete
knowledge of the state of the line to be had in the controlling
office, as well as in all the offices tributary to the dispatching system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs80">DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.</p>

<p>While it is not our intention to take up your time with the recital,
even in condensed form, of the development of all the items which
go to make up the parts of a railroad, we cannot forego the opportunity
to speak briefly about the locomotive, the motive power, giving
action and effect to transportation.</p>

<p>As early as 1680 Sir Isaac Newton predicted steam-propelled carriages,
and even made suggestions bearing on their design. Through
the eighteenth century various types of steam vehicles appeared,
more as curiosities than anything else, some of them forerunners
of the locomotive and others of the automobile. It was not until
1803 that anything really deserving the name "locomotive" was built.
Richard Trevithick, a Cornish miner, constructed the locomotive
bearing his name, curiously enough as the result of a wager. On
trial this machine did convey ten tons of iron for nine miles on a
cast-iron tramway by steam power, winning the wager. The desire
of Christopher Blackett, a mine owner, to use steam motive power
in place of animals led to the practical demonstration of adhesion.
On this principle, Blackett's Superintendent, William Hedley, built
his "Puffing Billy," a complicated affair of levers, beams and gears.
On the completion of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railroad, the
directors, being undecided as to the motive power, offered a prize
of five hundred pounds for a locomotive that would fulfill certain
conditions. The test came off at Rainhill, in October, 1829, on a
level piece of track about one and one-half miles long, between four
competitors. Stephenson's "Rocket" won and gave the world the
mechanical combination essentially represented in locomotive practice
since that time. American locomotive practice followed the
Stephenson model. Among the early builders were Phineas Davis,
Ross Winans and Matthias Baldwin. The four-wheel engines of
the English type proved injurious to the light rail and sharp curves
on our early roads, and to overcome this Mr. John B. Jervis, Chief
Engineer of the Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad, introduced the four-wheel
"Bogie" truck. For some twenty years this design remained,
until in the '50s the demand for more tractive power brought about
the addition of another pair of coupled drivers, thus evolving the
well-known "American" type. Additional drivers were added with
the demand for increased tractive power, leading in turn to the
development of the "Mogul" and "Consolidated" types.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>In the decade between 1880 and 1890 more drivers, such as in the
ten-wheel type, began to be used in high-speed service, and the
adaptation of wide fire-boxes to the American type necessitated the
addition of a trailer truck to support the rear end of the locomotive
frame, and brought about the "Atlantic" type, in 1895.</p>

<p>The "Pacific" type, or the most modern high-speed passenger locomotive,
is a development of this. In 1888 Anatole Mallett designed
the articulated locomotive. In 1904 the first one of this type was
placed in operation on an American railroad, and since that time has
gained favor where maximum tractive power on heavy grades is
required.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no more striking illustration of the progress
of the art than can be obtained from an examination of the illustrations
of the various types of locomotives built and operated since
1829. It all bespeaks a tremendous growth, based on a tremendous
necessity. We can point to the strengthening of all parts commensurate
with the work to be done; to the perfection of detail in
materials; manufacture, maintenance and inspection; and possibly
observe with pride that the motive power of the railroads of the
present contributes an almost negligible part of the difficulties of
modern railroad operation, due to features of design or control.</p>


<p class="pfs80">CAR CONSTRUCTION.</p>

<p>One of the early problems in transportation was to secure the
carrying capacity of cars as well as safety. We have pointed out
how it was necessary to add a guiding truck to the English locomotive,
designed to adapt the same locomotive safely to American
conditions. Both the excessive wheel loads on four-wheel freight
cars and the greater liability to accident or derailment led at an
early time to the use of four-wheel trucks under cars. Between
1831 and 1834 Mr. Ross Winans, of Baltimore, made improvements
on cars on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. He applied the
swivel four-wheel truck, the outside bearing for axles, and the application
of the draft gear to the car body and not to the trucks. The
increase in lengths of passenger cars, with corresponding increases
in weight, led, about 1880, to the quite general employment of a
six-wheel truck instead of a four-wheel truck, and even eight-wheel
trucks were used for a time, but rejected on account of the excessive
length of wheel base and other complications.</p>

<p>In 1879 the Allen wheel, consisting of built-up construction with
forged-steel tire, was introduced and rapidly became applied to cars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in the most exacting service. Originally the tires were imported
from the Krupp Works, in Germany, but later were manufactured
here.</p>

<p>Great interest attaches itself at the present time to the manufacture
of solid-steel forged wheels, on account of the reduction in
parts.</p>

<p>In the latter '80s experiments were made in the development of
steel framing for car construction, and built-up steel underframes
were introduced shortly after; at first on cars for mineral traffic,
where excessive weights and capacities were required. The success
of this type of construction has led to its adaptation at the
present time to all classes of equipment, and not only steel underframes,
but complete steel construction in certain classes of service
where the conditions require.</p>

<p>With the increase in through passenger service we note the
appearance of the vestibule, protecting the communication between
cars. Originally this vestibule was narrow, about the width of
the car door, and was introduced about 1882, although experimented
with as far back as 1845. The equipment of the "Exposition Flyer,"
operated from New York to Chicago during the World's Fair, was
the first, we believe, to appear with full-width vestibules, these being
originally designed as offering less atmospheric resistance to high-speed
trains, but having subsequently been found a more economical,
attractive and safer form of construction.</p>

<p>The question of steel cars and composite steel and wooden cars is
having very careful investigation and experiment at the present
time. While considerably used, the results of the use of these cars
must be awaited. After the factor of safety has been determined
the question of tare weight per passenger carried will naturally
arise. In this country our weights are now far in excess of all
foreign railroad practice. This enters into the resistance and cost
to produce the service.</p>


<p class="pfs80">CAR HEATING.</p>

<p>The original method of heating passenger cars by direct radiation
from coal or wood stoves was a source of discomfort to the passengers
as well as a menace in case of disaster. This brought about
in the late '80s the introduction of the "Baker Hot-Water Heater,"
which was a great improvement for the comfort of passengers, but
still left a fire in the car. In many instances of collisions and derailments
during this period, especially in winter, the cars were set on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
fire and the wreckage consumed from the fire scattered from the
stoves or heaters. Experimentally, steam from the locomotives was
used, but the difficulties in securing satisfactory couplings between
the cars, the drain on the boiler, and the fact that the locomotive
was sometimes detached from the train, were obstacles. One of
the Western roads even attached a separate car for the sole purpose
of supplying heat and light. The growth in the capacity of
locomotive boilers, and the perfection of the couplings between cars,
have led to the present practice of car heating, which entirely eliminates
the presence of any fire or source of danger from that source.</p>


<p class="pfs80">CAR LIGHTING.</p>

<p>Car lighting has passed through the same stages as house lighting,
possibly more gradually, on account of the greater difficulties. The
old low-roofed passenger cars were illuminated by candles about
two inches in diameter, placed in racks along the sides of the car.
With the advent of mineral oil, just before the Civil War, the candles
gave place to oil lamps. Great difficulty was experienced in
maintaining a steady flame, until the principle of the student lamp
was adopted. The flame was shielded from the outside air by a
chimney, and the central draft to the burner provided the air necessary,
at the right point, to insure combustion. For more than fifteen
years this method prevailed, and while the presence of oil
lamps in wrecks contributed fuel to the flames, the proof that they
were in any way the principal cause was lacking. Still, to eliminate
this contributory feature, attempts were made to use ordinary
coal gas, compressed in tanks on each car. This, however, proved
unsatisfactory. In 1870 a system of compressed gas made from
crude petroleum had been invented by Julius Pintsch, of Berlin,
and by 1887 had been put into a number of cars on European railroads.
The light was too dim to satisfy American conditions. It
was only a question of time, however, for its proper and adequate
development to our needs, when its use became general, on the
perfection of the lamp and burner.</p>

<p>For the last fifteen years electric lighting of various types has
been in use on cars in an experimental way. While possessing advantages,
perhaps, in safety, owing to low voltages and small quantity
of current, its general use has not yet been entirely practicable,
owing to the complications involved, either in generating and satisfactorily
controlling the current upon the cars, or in supplying it at
terminals through storage batteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>So far we have been considering largely features either of equipment
or train control. Perhaps more important than these is the
permanent way. Compared with engines, cars, signals and dispatching,
the variety of problems presented in the construction and maintenance
are many. We perhaps owe to the ancient beginnings and
highly scientific development of the profession of civil engineering
and its branches the fact that these problems of construction and
maintenance are so well met and the source of so little anxiety in
connection with railroad transportation at the present time. American
engineering ingenuity and courage have devised structures to
meet every requirement of railroad development. In bridge construction
for centuries the simple beam or the arch were the only
spans employed. The natural barriers to construction of railroads
required something more than either. Between 1830 and 1850 many
wooden trusses were built in the Eastern and Middle States after
the design of Burr and Palmer. S. H. Long's introduction of counter-braces
in truss construction in 1830 was a long step in advance,
and after ten years the celebrated Howe truss was brought out by
the inventor. Four years later came the Pratt truss. In 1859 several
riveted lattice trusses were built for the New York Central,
varying from 40 to 90 feet in length, by Howard Carroll. The
Lehigh Valley built a Whipple-Murphy pin-connected bridge of
165-foot span.</p>

<p>This progress in truss construction enabled the railroads to
bridge streams and secure continuous roadway.</p>

<p>As an interesting historical note in connection with railroad
bridges, we find that the first railroad bridge was built across the
Mississippi River at Rock Island in 1856. It had hardly been completed,
at great expense, before St. Louis steamboat interests demanded
its removal as a nuisance and an obstruction to navigation.
The United States District Court so adjudged it, and ordered its
removal within six months. The presiding judge in his opinion
stated that "if one railroad is able to transfer freight and passengers
without delay and expense of changing at the river, financial
necessity will compel competing roads to provide themselves with the
same facilities," which led him to foresee great interference to river
traffic and great mischief in the establishment of such a precedent.</p>

<p>The case was appealed, and Abraham Lincoln was the counsel for
the bridge company before the United States Supreme Court. He
argued that both the river and the railroad were great highways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
for the people, and while at the immediate time the water traffic was
possibly greater, he predicted that the time might come when the
railroads might equal or exceed the traffic on the river, and he consequently
felt that each interest was entitled to equal consideration.
His broad grasp of the subject secured for his company a reversal
of the decision of the lower court, and the bridge remained.</p>

<p>With the advent of steel the possibilities of bridge construction
may be said to have become almost unlimited, and their design
exceedingly simplified and standardized.</p>


<p class="pfs80">EVOLUTION OF THE RAIL.</p>

<p>Equally important is the evolution of the rail and its fastenings.
The type of metal rails of which the bottom served as the running
surface for flat wheels guided by a flange on the rail gave place to
"edge" rails on which flanged wheels used the upper surface of the
rail before the day of the steam locomotive.</p>

<p>Of the edge type, the first were cast iron, fish-bellied, in sections
about three feet in length. They were supported by stone blocks or
in cast-iron chairs which were in turn made secure to the stone.
Later the same type was made of wrought iron by John Birkinshaw,
in England, who rolled it up to 15 or 18 feet in length.</p>

<p>From 1820 to 1850 the flat strap rail, spiked to longitudinal timbers,
in turn supported by cross-ties, was largely used in this country,
as it was the only shape that could be rolled here. In 1834
Mr. Strickland designed the Bridge, or "U"-shaped section, which
was used on some of our earlier roads and was the first style of edge
rail rolled in this country, in 1844.</p>

<p>The present "T" section was invented in 1830 by Colonel Stevens,
Chief Engineer of the Camden &amp; Amboy Railway, and until
1845, when it was first rolled in this country, had to be imported
from England. The poor quality of the iron at this time required
such a broad support, in the design of the rail, for the head, that
no satisfactory plate fastening could be secured. Iron shoes, into
which the rail ends fitted, were the means of connection.</p>

<p>The greatest improvement dates from 1855, when the first steel
rails were rolled in England. Ten years later they were experimentally
rolled here. In 1867, through the introduction of the
Bessemer process, which made possible their manufacture at a
greatly reduced cost, began a revolution in track construction.</p>

<p>While the decade from 1880 to 1890 witnessed the greatest rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of railroad building in this country, it also witnessed the substantial
substitution of steel rails on our lines. The earlier rails weighed
from 50 to 70 pounds per yard. The increasing weight of equipment
brought out a heavier section, and fifteen years ago there was
a large percentage of mileage on which weights of 90 pounds and
over&mdash;and even 100 pounds&mdash;per yard had been introduced. Under
special conditions rails weighing as high as 140 pounds per yard
are used.</p>

<p>With the increasing weights of rails, and the development of steel
manufacture, greater attention has been paid to details of analysis,
process of manufacture, shape and laying, and it may be briefly
stated that all these matters are <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'uniformily'">uniformly</ins> prescribed at the present
time.</p>

<p>Our rail fastenings, ties and ballast have kept pace with the development
of the rail and equipment. An orthodox part of the rules
governing the maintenance of railway property places in the hands
of the maintenance force standard plans and specifications, not only
for the elements, such as rail and ties, but for the complete make-up
of the finished track structure and roadbed, and these plans are
the result of current experience and study of the several railroads,
and of the various associations of engineers, maintenance officers
and manufacturers, and it is safe to say that these plans, specifications
and standard practices represent the best known state of the
art.</p>


<p class="pfs80">GRADE-CROSSING ELIMINATION.</p>

<p>In the early days both the railroads and public ways used the natural
surface of the ground, as a matter of economy. The public
question then was how they were to get the railroads, and <em>not</em> how
they were to restrict them in the manner of their construction. The
districts traversed were sparsely settled and trains were few and
slow in their movement; the highways were little used; all of which
made for freedom from accident where the two crossed.</p>

<p>The conditions in England were vastly different. There the
country was thickly settled and an assured traffic was evident from
the inception of the enterprise, which would warrant expenditures
on original construction that could not be entertained by the promoters
of our first companies. So it was not through any blindness
that made grade crossings grow up in this country, but it was
purely the result of economic conditions which precluded their
elimination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>With the increase in population and the development of the country
came the need of increased transportation facilities. More frequent,
faster and heavier trains were moving up the railroads and a
greater number of people came to use the highways. The inevitable
result followed, and at length the great number of accidents occurring
at the grade crossings attracted public attention.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Massachusetts took the first action in 1869,
when it provided for the appointment of a Railroad Commission,
to investigate and report upon "Safer and Better Methods of Construction
and Operation." They very promptly took up the Grade-Crossing
question.</p>

<p>At this time in</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>This showed that the railroad network in Massachusetts was more
extensive in proportion to the area of the State than existed in
Great Britain. In their report the Commission suggested the avoidance
of future crossings of railroads and highways at grade, and the
propriety of the railroads changing some existing crossings which
presented no great difficulty or expense.</p>

<p>In 1873 a law was passed providing for the separation of grade
when a town and railroad effected an agreement. The cost was to
be apportioned by a Commission appointed by the Superior Court.
This law did accomplish something, but hardly abolished existing
crossings as fast as new ones were built. Under it the Fitchburg
Railroad did away with twenty-five between 1875 and 1890, bearing
varying portions of the expense.</p>

<p>In 1885 an Act provided that the County Commissioners could
order the abolition of a grade crossing on a petition of twenty legal
voters if the cost would not exceed $3,000. Again, in 1888 the Legislature
asked the Governor to appoint another Commission to investigate
and report upon a scheme for gradual abolition and the method
of apportioning the expense. In February, 1889, this Commission,
composed of Kimball, Weber and Locke, submitted systematic plans,
with estimates, etc., in which they fixed forty years as not an unreasonable
length of time for the completion of the work. The next
step came in 1890 with the passage of the Grade Crossing Law,
which provided that the directors of a railroad or the authorities of
a town or city could petition the Supreme Court for a Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
on the Abolition of a Grade Crossing. This Commission was to
determine the manner of the separation and by whom the work was
to be done, and how the expense was to be divided as between the
railroad, city and State. Before the report was presented to the
Court for approval it was incumbent upon the Commissioners to
ascertain that the aggregate proportion of the State's liability in this
connection would not exceed $500,000 per year for ten years. While
on the one hand the Legislature authorized this expenditure of
$5,000,000 to abolish the crossings of highways with railroads at
grade, they granted charters indefinitely to electric lines to cross
steam roads at grade.</p>

<p>The New York State Board of Railroad Commissioners was
created in 1882 and its membership appointed by the Governor.
Among the functions which they immediately assumed was the
question of public safety in connection with crossings at grade of
railroads and highways. The consideration which this received and
the complaints of unsafe conditions, as well as the complications
and adjudications involved, led to the passing of the Grade Crossing
Law, which went into effect July 1, 1897.</p>

<p>Not only by the New York State law, but by the Massachusetts
law, the method of elimination, as well as the apportionment of
expense, is specific. The initiative is open to both the railroad and
to the community, and the rapid progress of eliminations in these
two States may be taken as an endorsement of the wisdom of such
legislation, paving the way, as it does, for more progress on the
question of eliminations than it is believed would ordinarily take
place where no specific rule existed for the undertaking.</p>

<p>While the exact conditions throughout the country are not definitely
known, it is believed that progress is being made quite generally
in this direction. The influence of grade-crossing elimination
upon the safety of operation is of such importance as to deserve
serious consideration, as I will further suggest. Perhaps the elimination
of grade crossings, thereby separating the public from the
railroad except as authorized in connection with their patronage of
it, is one of the most important factors as safety.</p>


<p class="pfs80">HUMAN ELEMENT IN OPERATION.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great improvements in roadbed, track,
bridges, signals, equipment and other respects, all securing increased
service and safety in railroad operation, the human element is a
vital factor. With a view of raising the standard of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
service, a system of physical and educational examinations has been
adopted. In the early days of railroads the individual service was
possibly less definitely classified and qualified than must prevail
under the exactions of modern conditions. In keeping with the
progress in mechanical and safety devices and the necessity of a
better system, we have today a preliminary examination, both physical
and as to fitness. Employes must pass examinations as to
vision, color sense and hearing, and their knowledge of the fundamental
rules and regulations, as well as the fundamental knowledge
of road, appliances and equipment. These examinations are repeated
from time to time as the class of service and further advancement
of the employes may require. Many of the large railroads
have established schools, with capable instructors, where employes
may receive instruction upon the performance of their duties, as
well as affording them an opportunity to fit themselves for promotion.</p>

<p>Beginning with the General Time Convention some thirty years
ago, the need to standardize railroad practices and systematically
qualify employes began to be realized.</p>

<p>The Convention, largely through the efforts of Mr. W. F. Allen,
saw that, as time is the term in which railroad schedules are expressed,
it was a fundamental necessity that there should be standard
time, and that the timepieces of employes which should govern their
observance of instructions and schedules must conform to the standard.
This led to the present system of standard time; to the system
whereby employes must compare watches with standard clocks; must
have watches inspected regularly and record taken of same; must
compare watches and register before trips.</p>

<p>The General Time Convention led to the formation of the American
Railway Association, consisting of the executive and operating
officers of the railroads of the United States and Canada. The Association
considers problems of railroad operation, construction and
equipment, and recommends practices for their solution. Their
investigations, conclusions and recommended practices embrace train
operation, dispatching, block-signal operation, air-brake operation,
physical and educational qualifications of employes, regulations for
the transportation of dangerous articles, clearances, rail manufacture,
safety appliances, inspection, car construction, track gauge,
train heating and lighting, methods of loading, etc. Marked progress
has been made in co-ordinating the work of the various organi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>zations
of railroad officers with the work of the Association, to
secure the benefit of the broadest and most careful consideration of
the subjects.</p>

<p>Assurance, therefore, exists that the experience and knowledge
of railway management and officers will be brought from time to
time into the text and fact of standard practices, promoting convenience
by close interline relationships and uniformity of regulation,
and causing a uniform, systematic and careful regard for
safety.</p>


<p class="pfs80">BY WAY OF RECAPITULATION.</p>

<p>So, to recapitulate:</p>

<p>From a few miles of crude tramways the world has in a century
built 500,000 miles of steam operated and 100,000 miles of electrically
operated roads; instead of spragging the wheels we rely on
the automatic high-speed brake; the coupling of cars has become
an imitation of the action of human hands instead of risking their
destruction; each train finds the condition of road ahead and protects
itself by the agency of electric circuits and semaphores, the sequence
of whose operation discloses on behalf of safety any obstruction
of the route; four-wheel barrows are replaced by steel cars,
larger than the miner's cabin, and carrying more than his month's
output; instead of traveling on a tramway stage coach, the passenger
finds available for his comfort a modern hotel on wheels, with every
luxury known to-day&mdash;electrically lighted, steam heated, weather-proof;
the old strap iron, which became detached and penetrated the
car floor, frequently impinging passengers to the roof, is replaced
by the bar of steel weighing 100 pounds to the yard, whose manufacture,
installation and maintenance is prescribed with every degree
of refinement known to the chemist and engineer; we have learned to
treat sub-grade, drainage and ballast as an architectural science, and
our bridges, from the single-log span, now make continuous roadbed
for high-speed operation, even over the continental rivers.</p>

<p>Some one has said that the builders' art consisted in making the
structure proclaim the purpose for which designed, and to my mind
there is nothing which quite so dramatically fulfils this as the modern
steam locomotive. How many of you have seen a huge Pacific
locomotive, drawing a train of 600 tons at a speed of 70 miles an
hour, yet under control of one man, just the same as Stephenson's
"Rocket," which could have been lifted off its track and set on the
ground by four strong men, and which was a world-wonder when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for a short distance it attained a speed of twenty miles an hour? We
know that our engineman with a Pacific locomotive and the high-speed
train can stop his train with the air brake in a definite distance.</p>

<p>These comparisons, briefly as might be, between, we will say,
the beginnings of the nineteenth and of the twentieth centuries, show
how the commercial growth and increase of trade have produced a
demand for transportation to be performed, and with the performance
an economic revolution. We have, in a general way, though
with far less than the thoroughness of which the subject is worthy,
outlined what might be called the "state of the art," of railroad
plant and operation, in a relative sense.</p>

<p>Progress of a pronounced character has occurred. That this
progress has been accomplished by increased safety is demonstrated
by common knowledge and confirmed by the records, both of the
railroads and the public authorities. As an illustration, take the
statistics of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The increased
safety of railroad operation is indicated in part by the following
figures:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For the decade following the beginning of the records, namely,
1888 to 1897, the fatalities were 1 in 45,300,000; for the next decade,
bringing it down to the present time, the fatalities were 1
in 54,900,000; the gain in ratio being, for the nation at large,
fully 20 per cent.</p>

<p>Looking at the conditions in the State of New York, where the
density of travel is considerably in excess of that of the country
as a whole, we find a report of the State Engineer in the year 1862
showing ratio of fatalities of 1 in 28,200,000; the average for six
years, 1902 to 1907, inclusive, shows 1 in 200,000,000; an increase
in relative safety of 800 per cent.</p></div>

<p>We may assume that never before in the history of railroad transportation
was there presented a bigger problem than to-day. The
weights are greater; the distances are greater; the speed is greater;
the population is more dense; prices and wages are higher, and the
public service more exacting. A gathering of the official representatives
of the nation and of every State, possibly with a desire for
uniform and concerted action, even though it may be unofficial, points
with emphasis to the attitude from which the public contemplates the
employment of the railways in their behalf. It is, I believe, an accepted
fact of our political constitution at the present time that the
public, through its authorized representatives and through lawful
channels, has a right to be reasonably assured in this respect. I
believe that the co-operation manifested, as well as the inquiries by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the various railway boards, has in a great sense aided in reaching
our present standard of excellence, to which we can point with pride
in comparison with any other national railway system of the globe.
We are becoming more familiar&mdash;the railroad management and
employes&mdash;with the standpoint of the public, and the public is becoming
more familiar with the problems of the railroads. The
mutual aim is: First, safety and service; and, second, economy.
The public concern for the safety and service is for its own protection,
and the railroad management must give both with economy.</p>

<p>So far we have been dealing largely with the progressive safety
of railroad operation as furthered by the action of the railways,
either initiatively or responsively, as the case might be. We have
described the improvement in roadway, equipment and appliances;
the standardizing of regulations for operation; the selection of
employees and their government.</p>

<p>With the better understanding of the problem of the railroad
by the public through and in connection with the special boards
represented here today, it might not be amiss to express the hope
that such needs as cannot be met without the active support of public
opinion and perhaps legislation will be clearly brought out. One
of the thoughts that occurs to me was suggested by a recent exhibit,
from the records, of the loss of life, damage to railroad property,
as well as injury to persons and property conveyed, due to the
presence of unauthorized persons upon railroad property, whether
wilfully or carelessly trespassing. As an illustration of its seriousness:
during last year over 5,000 trespassers lost their lives on
railroads besides a large number injured. Numerous mishaps have
been traced to acts of trespassers, which may be the secret of many
unexplained casualties. The railroads are a highway for the
migration of tramps and unemployed persons, who commit petty
depredations, jeopardize the safety of trains and the lives of employees
and passengers. It seems of no avail that thousands of the
worst class are arrested by railroad police forces and convictions
secured, as the sentences in the majority of cases serve rather to
aggravate, than to mitigate, the evil. One line arrested over 9,000
trespassers during the past year, and secured convictions in 75 per
cent of the cases; but in half of them sentence was suspended,
which usually meant that the offender used the railroad to escape
from the scene. I do not wish to be understood to asperse the administration
of justice, nor to insist that offences of a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
character are always committed by railroad trespassers, but the
hazard involved is one that should not be permitted to exist, the
railroad property destroyed or damaged bearing no relation to the
risk of persons and property transported, and to the enormous loss
of life involved.</p>

<p>I feel that the attention of those accustomed to broadly viewing
problems of public concern should be brought to bear upon these
facts, with the hope that measures may be taken to insure greater
safety in this respect, as well as to save the waste of life and
property now resulting from or incident to the practice. I might
venture to suggest that the loss of life is far greater than entailed
through decades by boiler explosions or rear-end collisions, the
seriousness of which I do not wish to deprecate; and the situation
might warrant special record of the facts being obtained in behalf
of the public through the regular channels.</p>

<p>Wherein lies the increased safety of the future may perhaps be
the query in many minds. It is universally sought.</p>

<p>It would be mere conjecture on my part, and, with your indulgence,
I am not inclined to prophesy. As I see it, the great problem
is to make our progress sure, taking no doubtful measures,
adopting no specious devices which may appeal to us at first blush
until we have satisfied ourselves that no greater risk is involved
by the change.</p>

<p>The multiplication of rules enjoining obedience, together with
devices for additional protection, may yield a false sense of security
if fundamental obedience to existing rules and efficiency of existing
appliances is one bit impaired by the addition. We must not embrace
paper reforms, even though clamor and pressure be great.
An "ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure," we grant,
but reverse the proverb, and the pound of prevention may over-whelm
us. The public official would seem to be in a judicial position,
mindful of public justice and safety, basing his judgment
and acts upon facts alone. Improvement in general safety and
character of railroad operation must be the product not only of an
enlightened public opinion and the conservative wisdom of public
representatives, but progressive and careful management, coupled
with a sense of discipline and responsibility and industry of railroad
employees, who must jointly share the obligations of the problem.</p>

<p>Speaking of the compliance we have cheerfully made to the suggestions
of the public representatives&mdash;the Commissions&mdash;in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to improvements of service, facilities and conditions of operation,
etc., we believe in the long run that these things mean a better
standard and greater security for railroad property, as well as the
enormous benefit that accrues to the public by reason of proper
and efficient railway service, and we have only thoughts of admiration
for the attitudes of the Commissions as we have found them.
They have a large problem. We are glad to avail ourselves of
their wisdom, and believe it to be the means whereby the responsibility
of the carriers to the public is secured, and through whom the
responsibility of the public to the railroads must be voiced.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I thank you for your kind attention, and the favor,
which I acknowledge, of being permitted to address you as best I
may upon a subject to which we are all devoted. In the absence of
a distinct literature on the subject that your worthy President
assigned to me, my efforts are perhaps a bit crudely devised, having
no pattern. In another generation we may perhaps evolve a distinct
species of railroad statesman and an encyclopedia from which we
will be able to point back to the beginnings and the efforts at mutual
advice, and to the growth and knowledge that have ensued, just
as we have seen the day of small things in railroads to be the
beginning of a constant growth to the wonders of today. I am
sure that the American people can congratulate themselves upon
an institution of the character of your Convention and of your
several honorable bodies, and trust that this meeting will be such
that you will feel that you have made definite progress in your
concurrent aims.</p>

<p>The question of compensation to the railroads of the United
States for carrying the mails has been under review before Congress
at different times during the past ten years. The subject
was exhaustively investigated by a Joint Commission of the Senate
and House of Representatives in 1898 and 1899, which reached
the following conclusion after full consideration and taking of
a mass of testimony on all sides of the question:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Upon a careful consideration of all the evidence and
the statements and arguments submitted, and in view of all
the services rendered by the railroads, we are of the opinion
that the prices now paid to the railroad companies for the
transportation of the mails are not excessive, and recommend
that no reduction thereof be made at this time."</p></div>

<p>(See Report 2284, House of Representatives, 56th Congress, 2d
Session.)</p>

<p>This Commission also concluded as to the pay for railway postoffice
cars:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Taking in view all these facts as disclosed by the testimony
filed herewith, we are of the opinion that the prices paid as
compensation for the postal car service are not excessive, and
recommend that no reduction be made therein so long as the
methods, conditions and requirements of the postal service
continue the same as at present."</p></div>

<p>Since the above recommendations were made, the operating costs
on railroads, and, consequently, the cost of handling the mail, as
hereafter shown, have been largely increased, through higher prices
for both material and labor, so that if the railways were not over-paid
ten years ago, the present rates, being lower than those paid
at that time, would be too low and should really be increased to
give the railroads a reasonable return. Far from doing this, legislation
enacted in the past few years has had the effect of cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
down the mail pay of the railroads, whilst the special requirements
as to service and equipment have been made more severe
and exacting.</p>

<p>Recent acts of Congress or orders of the Postoffice Department,
which have the force of law, that have caused reduction of railroad
revenues, are the following:</p>

<p>1. Act of Congress of March 2, 1907, reduced pay on all routes
moving in excess of 5,000 pounds per day. This reduced the pay
for handling mails $1,740,494.63, or 3½ per cent. of the total earnings.
The same act reduced the rental rates for railway postal
cars $935,974.09 per annum, or 16 per cent. The total reduction
in pay to the railroads under this act was $2,676,468.72, or 6 per
cent. of the total compensation for both classes of service.</p>

<p>2. Act of Congress of June 26, 1906, effective July 1, 1906,
withdrew from the mails empty mail bags and certain supplies,
to be thereafter shipped as freight or express. It may be conservatively
estimated that the annual loss in mail revenue to the
railroads by withdrawing these shipments from the mails is at
least $1,000,000, with practically no reduction in space furnished
because of this change.</p>

<p>3. Order of Postmaster-General of June 7, 1907, changing
with each mail weighing thereafter the method of computing average
weights on which pay is based from that always previously
used and theretofore regarded as the proper interpretation of the
law. The effect of this on the mail weighings of 1907 and 1908
was to reduce railway mail pay in two sections of the country,
$2,222,108.92, or 9½ per cent., or at the rate of $4,500,000 per annum
for all roads of the country.</p>

<p>4. Orders of Postmaster-General reducing railway postal car
pay by allowing "shorter-car" pay on certain lines than heretofore
authorized and changing certain full lines to half lines; that is,
reducing pay for return movement, thus causing an annual loss
to the railroads of $345,287.06. (Second Assistant Postmaster-General's
Annual Report 1908, page 13.)</p>

<p>The effect of all of these reductions on the mail revenue of the
railroads aggregate $8,500,000 per annum, or 17 per cent. of the
total pay received by them in the year ending June 30, 1908, for
handling the mail and furnishing railway postal cars.</p>

<p>These reductions were made without justification and for the
purpose of reducing railroad revenues&mdash;and, incidentally, the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>penses
of the Postoffice Department, at a time when the net earnings
of the carriers seemed large to the public mind, although
under these favorable conditions the returns to the shareholders
approximated but 4 per cent., whilst farmers were receiving 10
per cent., manufacturers 15 per cent. and National banks 18 to
20 per cent.</p>

<p>It is true that there has been a large increase in the gross revenue
of the railroads in the last ten years, but this has accrued
from traffic other than carriage of the mails and has been accompanied
by great increase in operating expenses. In fact, were it
not for the economies of the carriers, effected by the use of more
powerful locomotives and larger freight cars, the increase in operating
expenses would, without doubt, have fully neutralized the
growth in revenue. In the months preceding the panic of October,
1907, the railroads were quite generally showing decreases in net
earnings in face of the largest gross earnings in their history. It
was costing them much more than a dollar to handle every dollar
increase in gross earnings.</p>

<p>Since the hasty enactment of ill-considered legislation reducing
mail pay, the revenues of the roads have been seriously affected
by a change in business conditions which has reduced traffic without
reducing prices of materials and labor. At the same time,
legislation has increased labor costs by reducing hours of service.</p>

<p>In 1898 rates for transporting the mails were too low to cover
the cost of service, they are much too low now, and the losses
on the mail service as a whole&mdash;there are some routes that pay&mdash;are
borne by freight traffic entirely.</p>

<p>The latest statistics of operations of all railroads of the United
States are for the year ending June 30, 1907, issued by the Interstate
Commerce Commission, July 9, 1908. From them we compile
the following exhibit comparing results of 1907 with 1898&mdash;when
a Commission of Congress, after complete investigation of
the subject, recommended that mail rates be not reduced.</p>

<p>Note.&mdash;Bear in mind these figures do not, of course, show effect of cut of
$8,500,000 in mail pay effective July 1, 1907, or losses in net revenue through
depression in business conditions commencing in latter part of 1907. As an
index of the latter, the Commercial and Financial Chronicle of September 5,
1908, showed that 141 roads, aggregating 168,839 miles or 70 per cent. of all
roads in the country, had suffered a loss of $63,484,902, or 24.97 per cent., in
net earnings in the first half of the calendar year 1908, as compared with same
period of previous year.</p></div>

<p>The foregoing statement clearly shows the difference between
the revenue obtained from passenger trains as compared with
freight trains. The control of the former is largely out of the
hands of railroad operating officers, as to meet competitive and
traffic conditions, heavier and more luxurious passenger cars must
constantly be furnished, which, of course, means largely increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
expense with very little increase in the paying train load. In fact,
as to the mails, notwithstanding an increase in tonnage carried on
the average train, the mail earnings per passenger train mile were
actually less in 1907 than in 1898, due largely to the automatic
reduction of railway mail pay per ton mile. Considering the
freight train mile, the composition of which is almost entirely
within the control of the railroads, which institute methods for
reducing cost of transportation, it will be observed that by such
methods the railroads have been enabled to place 58 per cent. more
tonnage in a train, bring them 58 per cent. more earnings, which
can be applied as an offset to the increase of 54 per cent. in the
cost of running a train one mile.</p>

<p>This increase in operating expenses per train mile last referred
to has been brought about largely because of the increased cost
of labor and materials, which, as is well known, has been general
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Comparing results of operation of all railroads of the United
States for the year ending June 30, 1907, with 1898, when this
question was last up, it is shown by reports of the Interstate Commerce
Commission that gross revenue from operations, as well
as income from investments, increased $1,380,000,000. This is
a very large sum, but let us see what becomes of it. Increased
wages paid to employes consumed $577,000,000, or 42 per cent.,
purchase of material included in operating expenses, $354,000,000,
or 26 per cent. of the increased income, and these material purchases
represented largely labor involved in their production. Increases
in betterments and miscellaneous deductions consumed
$77,000,000, or 6 per cent. of the increased income. Larger payments
for interest on funded debt and current liabilities consumed
$96,000,000, or 7 per cent., and larger taxes 2.5 per cent., leaving
$240,000,000, or 16.5 per cent. of the increased income for the
owners of the properties, the stockholders. In 1898 dividends were
less than 2 per cent. of the capital stock, and in 1907, even with the
large increase noted, they were only 4 per cent. Contrast this
with the manufacturers' returns of 15 per cent., the farmers' of 10
per cent., and the National banks' of 18 to 20 per cent. on their
capitalization.</p>

<p>Reduction in railway mail pay was not justified in 1898; it was
far less justified in 1907. On the contrary, there has been a large
fall in mail pay per ton mile, and conditions under which mails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
are transported are becoming more and more onerous. The cost
of building a railway postoffice car to the present plans and specifications
of the Postoffice Department is at least 50 per cent. more
than it was in 1898, although pay received for handling these cars,
that weigh from 25 to 30 per cent. more than formerly, has been
arbitrarily cut over 16 per cent. by the Act of Congress of 1907,
and has since been further cut through readjustment of routes.
For the year ending June 30, 1908, the railroads received gross
$48,155,379, including railway postoffice pay, for carrying 80 per
cent. greater tonnage of mails than in 1898, a sum $12,747,629
less than it would have been but for the reduction of rate from
12.59 cents in 1898 to 9.94 cents in 1908. In face of this, as we
have shown, arbitrary cuts of $8,500,000 more have been made,
a grand total of over $21,000,000 less paid now than ten years ago.</p>

<p>About eighteen months ago the conclusion was reached that
heavier and stronger cars were demanded by changed conditions
resulting in heavier trains, greater speed and increased frequency
and consequent risk of accident to clerks and mail in collisions and
wrecks. After careful investigation and expert testimony the
specifications were revised so that full 60-foot cars would weigh
about 100,000 pounds instead of 80,000 pounds, and be greatly
strengthened by the free use of steel plates and oak timbers. To
meet the views of car builders, east and west, two plans and specifications,
slightly differing, were adopted as standard, and railroads
were given the option of conforming to one or the other. The
best known anti-telescoping features were adopted in both plans,
producing in the judgment of responsible car builders a car of
exceptional resisting and carrying power. When new lines of cars
are authorized by the Department, or new cars are ordered to take
the place of old cars in service, companies operating the routes are
furnished copies of these specifications and the superintendent of
division is instructed to see that cars are built in conformity therewith.
Inspections are made while the car is in the shop, and when
it is completed a full report is made and forwarded to the Department.
A decision is then reached as to whether the car is satisfactory
and can be accepted.</p>

<p>(Annual Report Postmaster-General for 1905.)</p>

<p>This increase in weight of a postal car might not be thought
of much moment, but it means to the railroads the movement of
1,000,000 additional gross ton miles per car per year, costing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
$10,000 per annum in operating expenses, whilst, as shown, they
receive 16 per cent. less railway postoffice pay now than formerly.</p>

<p>United States Postal Laws and Regulations, Section 1164, provide
that the average weight of the mails used in fixing rates shall
be established by the actual weighing of the mails for a period of
not less than thirty days and "<em>not less frequently</em> than one in every
four years." The construction placed upon this by the Department
has been the one which reduced to the minimum the pay
which the railroads receive for services rendered. If mail traffic
were stationary, weighing every four years would not matter much,
but the increase of mail matter throughout the United States has
been very great, and, because of the policy of the Department, to
weigh the mails not more frequently than every four years, heavy
losses have resulted through the railroads having to haul tonnage
for three successive years following each weighing for which they
receive no pay.</p>

<p>As a result of this policy of quadrennial weighings, the roads
in Interstate Commerce Groups 7, 8, 9 and 10 (including the territory
west of the Missouri river and the Mississippi below St. Louis)
between 1878 and 1905 suffered a loss of $19,200,000, or 12 per
cent. of the aggregate railway mail pay, compared with what they
should have received if the mails had been weighed annually. In
other words, this loss is equivalent to a reduction in the rate received
per ton mile in these groups of states of 12 per cent. The
loss to roads in the western part of the United States is most striking,
due as it is to the rapid growth of that section. The same reduction,
though to a slightly less degree, obtains in other parts of
the United States.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COMPARATIVE RETURNS TO THE RAILROADS FROM CONDUCTING MAIL.
PASSENGER AND FREIGHT SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>In order to make a fair comparison of operating results from
different classes of traffic, it is necessary to consider them under
substantially similar conditions. The best measure of railroad
service is work done, or weight multiplied by distance carried; in
other words, the ton mileage. A comparison of services differing
so widely as the mail, passenger and freight on the basis of ton
mileage of such business is, however, unfair, because in the two
former an excessive proportion of dead weight must be transported
for each ton of paying load, whilst with freight traffic the proportion
of dead weight is small. The hauling power of a locomotive is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
measured not by revenue ton miles, but by ton miles of gross
weight, it making little difference to the locomotive as to what this
gross ton mileage is composed of, the gross tonnage and the speed
at which it must be moved being the factors that consume the
energy of the locomotive.</p>

<p>A computation has been made of ton mileage on each individual
mail route by multiplying weight carried by length of route; to
the sum of these we add the dead weight of cars. The report of
the Second Assistant Postmaster-General for year ending June 30,
1908, page 32, gives the number of cars engaged in mail service,
which we have multiplied by the average mileage made by the average
car, based on experience of the Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific Systems, to ascertain total car mileage for the United States.
Multiplying this by the dead weight of a car gives the ton mileage
of dead weight, which, added to the ton mileage of mails, gives the
gross ton mileage, measure of work and cost imposed on the railroads
in return for the pay they receive for handling the mails.
These computations are shown in the following statements, the
results being conservative, as for want of accurate data it has been
necessary to omit some work which the railroads do, which, if
ascertainable, would increase the cost. For example, we have made
no charge for the dead weight of that portion of baggage cars
devoted to the handling of pouch mail, such pouch service, according
to the Postmaster-General's report, covering annually on
railroads and express trains 122,027,597 miles; nor for the dead
weight of storage mail cars provided by the railroads. Neither has
any account been taken of the value of transportation given mail
clerks, which, based on the Postmaster-General's report of 1908,
amounted to 629,778,443 miles, which at 2 cents a mile would be
$12,500,000; nor for the value of transportation or postal commissions
of Postoffice Department officials; nor does it take into
account special service rendered by the railroads, such as delivering
mail at stations, value of space furnished by the railroads and required
of them by the Postoffice Department at important junction
and terminal points for mail distribution and accommodation of
government transfer clerks.</p>

<p>The statistics of passenger service in the following statements
are based on the 1907 Annual Report of Statistics of Railways published
by the Interstate Commerce Commission (1908 figures, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
would show higher operating cost, not available), with the exception
that the average mileage per car per annum run by passenger
cars is based on the experience of the Union Pacific and Southern
Pacific Systems.</p>

<p>Statistics of freight service are likewise based on the 1907 Report
of Statistics of Railways, freight car mileage being actually
reported by the Interstate Commerce Commission, dead weight per
car being computed from all freight cars handled on Union Pacific
and Southern Pacific Systems.</p>

<p class="pfs80">RELATIVE COST OF SERVICE.</p>

<p>To determine the relative costs to the railroads of performing
mail, passenger and freight service, we must allocate the expenses to
freight and passenger service as a whole, afterwards apportioning
the latter to mails and other service. Railroad operating expenses
apply jointly to both passenger and freight trains, so that, with
few exceptions, it is impossible to determine exactly from any published
statistics the cost of passenger train service as distinguished
from freight. There are some items of train mile expense directly
connected with movement which are less for passenger than for
freight trains, whilst, on the other hand, many other expenses are
greater for passenger than for freight, such as danger from casualties,
necessity of expensive terminals, delays to other traffic through
preference given to passenger trains, additional main tracks, and,
particularly, higher standards of maintenance of roadbed required
for high speed passenger train movement.</p>

<p>On account of the impossibility of separating the expenses, we
assume that the above factors about balance each other and that
the average cost of running <em>all</em> trains can be taken as either passenger
or freight train mile cost, respectively, without serious error.</p>

<p>We allocate a proportion of the passenger train cost to the mails
on the basis of the gross ton miles handled in each class of passenger
traffic.</p>

<p>The relative revenues and expenses are shown on opposite page,
mail revenues being as shown by 1908 Report of Postoffice Department,
and other statistics as given in the 1907 Statistics of Railways
of the United States, published by the Interstate Commerce Commission,
or are computed therefrom.</p>

<p>The above shows that whilst passenger service as a whole is unremunerative,
the mail earnings are hardly what they should be to
pay a fair share of the railroad operating expenses only, regardless
of taxes and interest.</p>

<p>Or, put in another way, our computations have shown that in
each passenger train run the railroads haul an average of 43/100
of a mail car, and the contents of this car yielded average earnings
of 9.4 cents for each mile run. The computation just made shows
that each freight car run, loaded or empty, yields a revenue to the
carrier of 10.5 cents per mile. Incredible as this may seem, it is understandable
when we reflect that the railroads transport 1.1 tons of
dead weight for each ton of freight for which they are paid; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mail they transport 21.7 tons, or twenty times as much. The freight
rate is .759c per ton mile, the mail rate 9.94c, or only thirteen times
as much.</p>

<p>Arguing in still another way: Average number of cars in each
passenger train handled in United States is 3.95, of which mail
cars amount to 0.43, or 11 per cent. Eleven per cent. of the average
earnings of a passenger train is 13.8 cents, but mail contributed
only 9.4 cents. That is, it should pay 47 per cent. more than it
does to be made to contribute a fair share to the insufficient earnings
of a passenger train. Mails are fairly responsible on basis of
space used for 11 per cent. of the cost of running a passenger train,
or 16.17 cents, and as dead weight per foot of space is greater with
mails, their proportion of train mile cost is even larger. They pay
little more than one-half this cost.</p>

<p>By building larger capacity cars and larger engines, the cost of
handling freight traffic, entirely in the control of the carrier, has
been reduced to follow rate reductions and increased expenses.</p>

<p>On the other hand, because methods of conducting passenger
traffic are largely&mdash;and mail traffic entirely&mdash;beyond their control
the cost of handling mail and passengers has been steadily increasing,
and, as revenue has not increased, the net revenue or margin
of profit has been cut to a point where it is unremunerative.</p>

<p>The argument advanced by advocates of reduced mail pay, that
increasing density permitted economies and that lower rates would
yield more net, is not applicable when the carriers' hands are tied
and measures of economy so successfully applied to handling freight
are prohibited. The following will illustrate this:</p>

<p>On routes where pouch service is used mail is handled with express
and baggage without much increase of cost over other passenger
traffic. A somewhat greater mail traffic obliges the railroads
to furnish apartment cars, at increased expense and dead
weight for the postoffice feature, but still permitting the railroads
to carry other traffic in the same car. A still further increase in
weight means the establishment of full R. P. O. lines for which
the railroads receive extra, but inadequate, compensation, these cars
being used for no other class of traffic and adding largely to the
weight and cost of train service. Even after the route has been
made an R. P. O. route, the railroads are not permitted to economize
by carrying more mail in the car, and as traffic density grows
the roads must under the requirements of the Department add more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
cars, almost in proportion to the business, as the loads carried in
R. P. O. cars, as shown by recent special weighing, average only 2¾
tons, and many of them return empty&mdash;for which empty haul the
railroads often receive no pay. When the mail business has assumed
very large proportions and the R. P. O. cars have multiplied
in ratio therewith, special trains are then added to carry the bulk
of the mail, being run at very high speed and adding to the railroad
expense account in a far higher degree per unit of business than
any other class of traffic.</p>

<p>In contrast to the above, baggage and express are very generally
hauled in the same and a much lighter and less costly car than
the mail car, and increase in tonnage is accommodated by hauling
greater loads per car. In the case of freight, increased density
means larger car and train loads and greatly reduced costs of operating
per ton mile.</p>

<p>Despite these differences in conditions, the automatic scale has
secured to the Government a larger reduction in mail rates per ton
mile in the last ten years than the percentage of fall in freight
rates, despite higher labor and material costs of railroad operating.
As a result, the mail business&mdash;which, according to evidence introduced
before the Congressional Committee of 1899, was unprofitable
at that time, has been made more unprofitable at the present time
by the heavy rate reductions of 1906-7.</p>

<p>As the greatest reduction made deals with mail routes on which
traffic is heaviest, a consideration should be given to the following
conditions of handling mail on such routes:</p>


<p class="pfs80">HEAVY TRAFFIC MAIL ROUTES.</p>

<p>On very many of the heavy traffic routes where the principal reduction
in pay occurred a large part of the mail is now handled in
special mail trains run at excessively high rates of speed. Such
trains introduce the following conditions:</p>

<p>1. A very much greater liability to accident. A large proportion
of the deplorable accidents that have occurred on the American
railroads in recent years have occurred to excessively high speed
trains, accidents to such trains being almost invariably destructive
to life and property. An examination of serious accidents on the
Union Pacific System and Southern Pacific Company for the calendar
year 1906 shows that 36 per cent. of the property damage from
all causes, including negligence, as traceable to trains not under
control and excessive speed, whilst 30 per cent. additional damage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
was due to causes that might prevent inferior trains getting out of
their way, such as keeping main line on time of superior trains,
failure to observe signals or orders, etc.</p>

<p>2. Mail trains run at excessive high speed are much more expensive
to operate than other trains, for the following reasons:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) Fuel consumption per traffic unit is very much greater
at high speed because of diminished tractive power of locomotives.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A relative greater hauling capacity of locomotives must
be consumed in moving trains at higher speeds.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Excessive speed requires higher standards of track
maintenance, double-tracking, block signals, heavy rail, better
ballasted roadbed, etc., etc.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) High speed means increased wear and tear on equipment
and track.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) High speed trains are expensive, delaying and adding
to the cost of other traffic.</p></div>

<p>3. Speed of trains carrying mails has been constantly increased,
a study made of the speed per hour made on fastest trains on which
R. P. O. cars are handled on seventeen of the principal mail routes
giving the following results:</p>

<p>Average of fastest train on seventeen mail routes:</p>

<p>With the above increase in speed, rates paid the railroads have
automatically decreased whilst expenses have largely increased to
provide for the above greater speed and because of increase in
prices of labor and materials of all kinds in the past five or six
years. This increase in speed has been made coincident with growth
of freight traffic, which is the railroads' profitable business, <em>the non-profitable
high speed trains delaying the profitable ones, increasing
their cost and incurring liability to accident</em>.</p>

<p>4. Earnings of mail trains supposedly high are not higher than
other passenger trains, which, as a whole, earn very much less per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
mile run than freight, relative figures being as shown by last report
of the Interstate Commerce Commission&mdash;as 100 is to 218, whilst
the cost of running passenger trains is as much, if not more. This is
particularly the case with high speed passenger trains, which is
the most unprofitable business in which railroads are engaged. (On
Union Pacific System last year earnings per passenger train mile
were $1.71, per freight train mile $4.31.)</p>

<p>5. Passenger engines in hauling fast passenger trains on principal
main lines at the present time have assumed, on account of
increased weight of equipment and excessive speed required, enormous
proportions. We now have in such service on our lines engines
weighing exclusive of tender 222,000 pounds, this power being
60 per cent. heavier and twice as costly as locomotives used in
the same class of service ten years ago, burning double the amount
of fuel. Engineers running these locomotives receive higher pay
because of the greater size of these engines&mdash;to say nothing of recent
increases made in their schedules. Such heavy power moving
at fast speed is extremely destructive to the roadbed, requiring
a much higher standard of maintenance than formerly, maintenance
of way cost in the past few years having gone up 50 per cent. Engine
failures are largely confined to fast passenger trains, and, in
general, expenses are increased all along the line because of their
introduction.</p>

<p>6. As illustrating the additions to expenses because of increased
track maintenance on account of fast passenger and mail trains, we
have made a study of statistics, using the Interstate Commerce report
of 1906 as a basis, of seven roads having a large proportion
of fast passenger service and seven roads having a moderate speed
passenger service, but with a large proportion of freight service. On
the roads first named the average cost of maintenance of way per
mile was $2,951, and on roads in the latter class $1,565. The operating
expenses per train mile in the former class were $1.47, and
in the latter $1.33. The roads in the former class, on account of
large number of excessively high-speed trains, were obliged to double-track
their lines, which directly increased maintenance expenses.</p>


<p class="pfs80">PAY FOR RAILWAY POSTAL CARS.</p>

<p>The large reduction made by Act of March 2, 1907, in pay for
railway postal cars was made in face of large increase in the cost
of constructing such cars, due to higher prices of labor and material
and greater cost of meeting the more exacting specifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the Postoffice Department. Changing to steel construction, increases
in weight, and generally heavier operating expenses, have
created an extremely large increase in cost of moving these cars. The
standard railway postal car of only a few years ago, 60 feet long,
weighed 80,000 pounds and cost about $5,500. The standard railway
postoffice cars, 60 feet long, of wooden construction, used on
the railroads with which I am connected, weigh over 100,000 pounds
each, or one-fourth more weight, and costs 40 per cent. more,
whilst our new standard postal cars of steel construction weigh
108,000 pounds and cost over $9,000, or 60 per cent. more than the
car of a few years ago.</p>

<p>An argument sometimes made in favor of a lowering of R. P.
O. car pay is that for apartment cars used in runs where mail
density does not require a full car, no additional compensation is
allowed. But we feel that a fair consideration of the circumstances
under which mail is handled as compared with other traffic will
justify the conclusion that this is not an argument in favor of reducing
R. P. O. pay, but rather for allowing the railroad additional
compensation for the apartment cars as well. Both services require
the furnishing of special features in the way of traveling postoffices
not required except for the convenience of the Postoffice
Department to enable it to do work while mail is in transit, such
as ordinarily performed in office buildings. The full postal car
is more expensive to the roads, as it always means additional car
service, whilst in some cases of apartment cars the space not occupied
by the traveling postoffice is adequate to take care of baggage
and express, though very frequently this service also means
additional car movement that would not be necessary but for the
postoffice feature.</p>

<p>The saving to the railroads from reduction in car mileage that
would be possible if it were not obliged to furnish traveling postoffices,
but could use the space occupied by racks and other postoffice
features by loading additional mail in cars, would be many
times the revenue allowed by the railway postal cars.</p>

<p>To illustrate: The car mileage of postal cars (changing apartment
cars to full cars on basis of length) is 232,180,000 per annum;
the ton mileage of mail 484,683,135, or 2.09 tons per car.
From figures obtained from the Postoffice Department, average car
weights shown on page 59, table "EE," special mail weighing of
1907, it is ascertained that storage mail cars, which, of course, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>tain
no postoffice features, carry an average of 7.04 tons of mail.
At this rate the whole mail business could be carried by the movement
of 68,844,000 car miles, or 163,336,000 less than actually employed,
due to the postoffice features. The total railway postal
car pay is only $4,567,366, or only 2.8 cents per additional car
mile, whilst the operating expenses chargeable to running these
163,336,000 car miles, of 70 per cent. of the total movement, amount
to $67,000,000.</p>

<p>But for the postoffice feature, the combined weight of an entire
route could many times be handled in a single car such as is used
for express instead of several heavy and expensive postoffice cars,
whilst often extra cars for storage mail must be added, for which
no extra pay is allowed, the cost of running these storage cars also
not being included in the computation of cost of service, as no accurate
statistics of their number or car mileage are available.</p>

<p>In addition to the furnishing of storage cars, although many R.
P. O. routes are paid for on a basis of 40 foot cars, it is not economical
for the railroads to construct such cars which are not
interchangeable with other equipment and which would have to be
thrown aside if through growth of traffic larger cars are afterwards
required. As a result, full 60-foot R. P. O. cars have for years
been furnished on many 40 and 50-foot routes, the railroad getting
no credit for this, whilst on many other routes R. P. O. cars have
been run in advance of the fixing of R. P. O. pay for them.</p>

<p>On a number of routes postal car pay has been allowed for running
full cars in one direction only, classing such routes as half-lines.
This obliges the railroads to move the car in the opposite
direction without pay, the small additional compensation of less
than 4 cents per mile run received in one direction being entirely
inadequate to compensate the road for the empty haul&mdash;to say nothing
of allowing anything for moving it in direction for which pay
is received. To illustrate: The Union Pacific Railroad in one case
between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Ogden, Utah, 1,003 miles, receives
no pay for handling east-bound a 60-foot mail car, which
is paid for west-bound only, six mail cars being required on this
line. The R. P. O. pay per car mile, including movement in both
directions, is only 2.24 cents, or about what would be received
for transporting a single passenger, although a standard passenger
coach has a capacity for 70 passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with the railway postoffice, an item not often considered
is the value of transportation furnished clerks in the railway
mail and compartment cars. Figuring this at 2 cents per mile,
which is about the lowest passenger fare, the total value of this
transportation for clerks in railway postoffice cars would be $8,600,000
per annum, or $4,000,000 more than the railroads receive
for the handling of these cars, and the value of transportation in the
case of apartment cars would be $4,000,000 per annum additional.
In addition to this, a large amount of free transportation is required
annually by the Postoffice Department for inspectors and
other officers of the Department.</p>

<p>The Postoffice Department issues annually about six hundred
traveling commissions to postoffice inspectors and other postal officials,
and requires railroad companies to honor such commissions
for free transportation on all trains on all lines on which mails are
carried. In some cases these commissions are issued to Government
officials whose official duties are in no way connected with the
transportation of mails on railroads. The railroads have no control
whatever over the issuance of these commissions and can not even
secure from the Postoffice Department a list of them, the Department
holding that the list is confidential. These commissions are
frequently used for personal travel in violation of the rulings of
the Interstate Commerce Commission. In brief, the Postoffice Department
in effect arbitrarily issued about six hundred annual
passes over every mail carrying railroad in the United States, which
is equivalent to about 200,000 annual passes.</p>


<p class="pfs80">POSTAL DEFICIT.</p>

<p>In investigating the subject of railway mail pay, we have been
struck very forcibly with changes which have taken place in the
revenues and expenditures of the Postoffice Department since 1899,
when this subject was last reviewed. Although postal operations still
show a deficit, it is a fact that its revenues have increased in a remarkable
degree, and the deficit is certainly not due to the amounts
paid to the railroads for hauling mail, as these payments are relatively
far less now than formerly. Revenues of the Postoffice Department
have grown from $102,000,000 in 1900 to over $191,000,000
in 1908, or 87 per cent., this increase in revenue in eight years
being as great as the entire increase in the previous thirty-five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>But in this same period of eight years there was an increase of
$100,600,000, or 93 per cent., in Postoffice Department expenditures,
of which only $10,900,000, or 11 per cent., was paid to the
railroads, $33,935,000, or 34 per cent., going to Rural Free Delivery,
$25,000,000, or 25 per cent., to postmasters and their clerks,
and the balance to other items.</p>

<p>The following statement shows for the year 1895 and for the
years 1899 to 1908, inclusive, postal revenue and postal expenditures
divided between amounts paid the railroads, cost of rural delivery
and other expenditures:</p>

<p>In order to avoid a deficit, attention has been concentrated on
this 25 per cent. of the postal expenditure, which we contend is
at least not an unfair compensation to the railroads for services
rendered. Though the proportion of the total revenue going to the
railroads has fallen one-third in ten years, the deficit still remains,
and is it reasonable to suppose that any reduction in railway mail
pay would not be speedily absorbed in other directions? On the
contrary, ought not efforts be concentrated to bring within reasonable
figures the other expenses of the Department, which now absorb
84 per cent. of its revenue as compared with only 69 per cent.
in 1900&mdash;despite an actual growth in postal revenue in the same
time of $89,000,000, or 87 per cent.?</p>

<p>It will be noted from these figures that a reduction of 10 per cent.
in the ratio of railway mail pay to total revenue can be entirely
wiped out by an increase of only 3 per cent. in other postal expenses,
whilst a retrenchment of 10 per cent. in the latter would
have put the Department almost on a paying basis, notwithstanding
the heavy cost of Rural Free Delivery. From 1895 to 1908 actual
totals show that the railroads' pay has increased 54 per cent. for
handling 114 per cent. more mail tonnage, whilst in the same period
other expenses of the Postoffice Department have grown 178 per
cent., revenues increasing 149 per cent.</p>

<p>Increased mail business means a direct increase in postal revenue,
as postage remains the same regardless of tonnage, but carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
this increased business on the part of the railroads means less proportionate
revenue to them according to volume of tonnage, so that
the proportion of the postal revenue they now receive is very much
less than formerly. Labor, material, and the price of everything
sold in commerce have advanced materially, as we all know, in the
past seven or eight years; railway mail pay being practically the
only thing that has decreased in the face of conditions that should
have raised it.</p>

<p>As a large increase in mail tonnage means to the Postoffice Department
about an equal increase in revenue with a decreased payment
per ton to the railroads through lower rates, the avoidance of
a deficit would seem not a difficult matter if other postal expenses
were kept at least within sufficient control, so they would not increase
faster than the increase in volume of mail handled.</p>

<p>The Postoffice Department enjoys this peculiar advantage of receiving
with the growth of the country an increase in revenue directly
in proportion to the increase in business handled. In disbursing
this revenue, it must pay less to the railroads in proportion
to the density of business, thus retaining to apply on other expenses
a larger net revenue year by year. It is reasonable to suppose that
the cost of many branches of the Department should not increase
in the same ratio as tonnage of mail (for example, that expenses
of individual postoffices and administrative and general expenses
should not grow in this proportion). Yet, regardless of these favorable
influences, expenditures in other directions have absorbed
the great net revenues after paying the railroads, and it is in these

OF RAILWAY EARNINGS</a></h2>

<p class="center smcap">By C. C. McCain.</p>

<p class="center">Chairman of the Trunk Line Association, New York, 1909;
Formerly Auditor Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>


<p class="pfs80">INTRODUCTION.</p>

<p>The ten years or more which have elapsed since the resumption
of industrial activity that began some time in 1897 have been characterized
by changes in rates of wages for substantially all kinds of
labor, and in the prices of most commodities which amount to a
profound and material alteration in the value of money. Wages of
railway labor, prices of railway materials and supplies and prices of
commodities carried by railways and of those produced by the purchasers
of railway transportation have rapidly increased. This is
equivalent to a decrease in the value of the money in which railway
charges are paid <em>for the appreciation of commodities is the depreciation
of money</em>. Commodities cannot have generally augmented value
without money having diminished value. Railway rates have not
been adjusted to this diminished value of money. The involuntary
and unsolicited reduction in railway rates has gone so far as seriously
to threaten the stability of railway wages and that of the whole railway
industry. Some adjustment through compensatory advances
in money rates (<em>i. e.</em>, nominal rates) is, therefore, absolutely necessary.
The extent of the changes which have taken place, their
relation to the problem of railway rates and the adjustments which
they have made necessary are set forth in the following pages.</p>


<p class="pfs80">TYPICAL UNCHANGED RATES.</p>

<p>A fifteen-ton car-load of fourth class freight carried all-rail between
Chicago and New York at any time during the year 1897
would have brought the railways transporting it $105.00 in gross
receipts.</p>

<p>There has been no change in the class-rates between Chicago and
New York since 1897 and the same quantity of freight, classified in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the same way, produces the same gross receipts now that it did in
1897.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>The rates between Chicago and New York, as is very well known,
are the basis of all rates in the region north of the James, Potomac
and Ohio Rivers, and east of the Mississippi River and of a large
proportion of the rates applicable to traffic originating or destined
to any point in that region. Without a change in rates between
Chicago and New York there could have been, during the continuance
of the system of rate adjustment that has been in force since
long prior to the year 1897, no general change in the rates based
upon those in force between those cities.</p>


<p class="pfs80">WAGES OF RAILWAY EMPLOYEES.</p>

<p>More than forty per cent. of the gross receipts of the railways
of the United States are expended in the payment of employees, the
sums annually paid out for that purpose since 1897 being as follows:</p>

<p>It is a matter of common knowledge and of frequent comment
that a given sum of money will now buy very much less in labor
or commodities than it would in 1897. The change has been gradual
but substantially continuous and the aggregate result has been
enormous. The consequence of this change has worked great
hardship to those whose incomes have not been adjusted to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>changed purchasing power of money but fortunately the rates of
wages of nearly all workmen and the prices of practically all products
of labor expended upon farms or in factories or otherwise have been
raised sufficiently to more or less completely offset it. The principal
sufferers are those salaried employees whose salaries have not been
readjusted and those whose incomes are received under contracts
covering long periods of time or are derived from the marketing of
commodities or services at prices more or less effectively controlled
by custom or statute. Many of the owners of railway bonds are in
the second class and all interstate railways are, as to the disposal
of their services, in the third class.</p>

<p>As already noted, the gross revenue derivable by the railways
from the transportation of a carload consisting of fifteen tons of
fourth class freight between Chicago and New York is the same now
that it was in 1897&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, $105.00. But $105.00 is worth much less
to any railway now than it was in 1897 for money is worth at any
time what it will buy at that time. The reports of the Interstate
Commerce Commission show the following increases in rates of
average daily wages paid to railway employees:</p>

<p>The foregoing shows that on the average the gross railway receipts
derived from the service assumed as the basis of the calculation
would purchase 16.27 per cent. less of the necessary services of railway
employees, in 1907 than in 1897 and what is true of the receipts
from this service is true of every dollar received by a railway&mdash;that
is, no railway dollar will pay for more than eighty-four per
cent., on the average, as much railway labor as it would in 1897.</p>

<p>The change in railway rates necessary fully to offset this decrease
in the value of the money in which rates are paid would amount to
an apparent advance of 19.43 per cent, of the money rates now in
force.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COST OF FUEL FOR LOCOMOTIVES.</p>

<p>Next to labor the principal single item of expense incurred in the
operation of the railways of the United States is for the fuel used
in their locomotives. The expenditures for this purpose now constitute
about eleven per cent. of the cost of operation and since 1897
have been as follows:</p>

<p>Thus, from 1897 to 1907, the cost of fuel for locomotives, in spite
of the economies in its use partially suggested by the contemporaneous
increase in the train-load of freight from 204.62 to 357.35
tons, or 74.64 per cent., increased 207.88 per cent., while passenger
traffic increased but 126.15 per cent. and freight traffic by 148.69
per cent. Thus while there was one dollar spent for locomotive fuel
in 1897 for each $17.25 of gross railway receipts the ratio had
declined by 1907 to one dollar for locomotive fuel for each $12.93 of
gross receipts&mdash;a difference which must plainly be productive of
profound changes in the proportion of gross receipts remaining after
the payment of necessary operating expenses. The average prices
of coal, per ton of 2,000 pounds, at the mines, in the several states,
in the years 1897 and 1907, as given by the United States Geological
Survey, were as follows:</p>

increased prices of railway supplies. It is plain that as to all of the
important supplies and materials included in the foregoing list the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
$105.00 of gross receipts from the typical shipment heretofore used
as an example would show the same, or a greater, loss in purchasing
power which has characterized the comparisons previously shown.</p>

<p>Evidence from official sources thus shows that in purchasing the
same quantities either of labor or of supplies the railways have now
to expend much larger sums than they did ten years ago. The
official statistics already quoted are fully supported and their pertinence
to the problem in hand is fully proven by the accounting
records of the purchasing departments of the several railways. The
Trunk Line Association has obtained detailed information concerning
purchases in 1897 and 1907, by important railways represented
in its organization, and this information has been carefully
and accurately tabulated. A table showing the largely increased cost
of articles which this tabulation reveals has been made Appendix
B and will be found at pages 194 to 198 of this pamphlet. An
examination of this appendix and, particularly of the classes of
labor and of the articles shown to have greatly increased in cost,
discloses the unquestionable fact that the increased cost pervades the
whole aggregate of operating expenses and that there is no considerable
exception to the rule that every item of operating expenditure
is now very much greater than it was in 1897.</p>


<p class="pfs80">OTHER COSTS OF SUPPLYING RAILWAY SERVICES.</p>

<p>The cost of railway transportation which must be borne out of the
receipts for railway services includes operating expenses, interest
on capital and taxes. Before discussing the increase in the rate of
interest demanded it is worth while to note that the exactions made
by the taxing power upon the railways have also notably increased.</p>

<p>The sums annually paid as taxes on railway property since 1897

<p>Thus in the years from 1897 to 1907 railway taxation per mile
of line has increased from $235.36 to $353.09, or no less than 50.02
per cent.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COST OF REGULATION.</p>

<p>Closely akin to taxation of railway property are the additional
expenses which have to be met out of railway revenues on account
of public regulation. The increased and, in many cases, minute
regulation imposed by the Hepburn law of 1906 and the rules and
requirements established thereunder by the Interstate Commerce
Commission and by various State enactments have caused the railways
many new and augmented expenditures. Among the many
purposes for which these expenditures have become necessary are
those enumerated below:</p>

<p>1. Preparation, publication, filing, posting, etc., of rate schedules.</p>

<p>2. Compilation and tabulation of statistics, preparation and
filing of annual reports of operation and finance.</p>

<p>3. Litigation under regulatory statutes including cases before
National and State commissions and including legal and incidental
expenses thereof.</p>

<p>4. Appliances and special equipment required by safety appliance
laws.</p>

<p>5. Additional employees and additional wages paid on account
of laws regulating the hours of labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these and other positive additions to the expenses of
operation there have been considerable reductions in revenue
brought about by the various regulative statutes. Thus there
have been reductions in revenue caused by the following:</p>

<p>1. Orders, or suggestions having practically the force of
orders, requiring changes in the classification of freight.</p>

<p>2. Orders, or suggestions having practically the force of
orders, requiring reductions in rates.</p>

<p>3. Statutory reduction in the rates of compensation for carrying
the mail.</p>

<p>4. Reduction of compensation for carrying the mail made by
executive order.</p>

<p>A painstaking effort to secure accurate statistics concerning
recent increases in these expenditures and losses has been made
and data for that purpose have been supplied by many of the
railways operating east of the Mississippi river. These data are
necessarily incomplete and fragmentary, the accounts of many
of the companies not being kept in such form as fully to disclose
the items desired. In few cases were the data which could be
obtained for any line complete&mdash;some companies were able to
report particular items while other companies could not give
these, but could supply others. Generally speaking, it should
be realized that the tabulation of these reports makes a showing
which is incomplete mainly in the form of omissions. A conservative
computation discloses that the costs due to increases
in expenses or reductions in revenue imposed by statutes or by
Commissions acting under Federal and State regulatory laws
costs the railways of the United States approximately $200,000,000
in two years. That this is not an exaggerated estimate will
be appreciated by reference to the principal general items of expenditures
as enumerated on the preceding pages. Until
these items shall have been assigned a proper classification in
the accounts of the railroads the accurate results may not be
ascertained, but it will at once occur to those in any measure informed
that there has been an enormous increase of work and
expense placed upon the carriers to conform to the innumerable
requirements of State and Federal laws and the rulings of the
Commissions thereunder, and that this burden has extended to
all departments of the carriers. Litigation and miscellaneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
expenses appear as a large part of these new costs, and in addition
the carriers' revenues have been greatly depleted either
directly by the laws, orders of Commissions or suggestions having
practically the force of orders, resulting in reductions of
freight and passenger charges.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COST OF OBTAINING NEW CAPITAL.</p>

<p>In the matter of interest on the capital employed the railways
have apparently enjoyed an advantage which would seem to
offset the natural tendency of interest rates to rise in response
to the stimulus of augmented cost, in dollars and cents, of the
commodities entering into the budget of expenditures of the
average recipient of interest&mdash;that is to say, the advantage growing
out of the fact that a large proportion of railway capital is
secured under long-time contracts and that many of the contracts
now in force unquestionably run back to a time before the
extensive depreciation of the American dollar began. This advantage
is a real one, but its extent is easily exaggerated. For
the purpose of throwing light upon the effect upon the cost of
railway transportation of the rise in interest rates which has
characterized recent years an analytical study of railway indebtedness
(including guaranteed dividends) amounting, in the
aggregate, to $9,499,099,065 has been made. This sum represents
indebtedness now outstanding and includes some duplication
owing to the fact that certain of the securities represented
in the aggregate are themselves based upon other securities
deposited as collateral or held in the treasuries of the
corporations making the secondary issues; duplication which could
not be eliminated without adding vastly to the difficulty of the
inquiry with no corresponding gain in the accuracy of the result.
These data are also subject to the qualification necessarily due to
the fact that all of the issues included were not sold at par. In
some cases a small premium was doubtless obtained and in other
cases a slight discount was required, but, nevertheless, it is believed
that the data fairly indicate the general change in interest
rates on capital loaned to railways. Of the total outstanding indebtedness
of $9,499,099,065 the portion incurred during the years
1897 to 1908, inclusive, amounts to $5,466,340,252, or 57.55 per
cent. The following table shows the amounts incurred at the
different rates during each of the years named:</p>

<p>Even a cursory examination of the foregoing statement shows
that the average rate of interest demanded by those who supply
railway capital has greatly increased. In 1897 and 1898 the largest
aggregate of new indebtedness was incurred at the rate of three
and one-half per cent. per annum; in 1899, 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904,
1905 and 1906 the preponderating portion was at four per cent.; in
1907 the largest aggregate was at five per cent., while in the months
of 1908 for which data are available the greater portion was obtained
at six per cent. Loans at three and three and one-half per
cent., which supplied a considerable aggregate during all of the
years to and including 1906 and particularly in the earlier years
of the period, had substantially disappeared before 1907 and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
funds were procured at less than four per cent. during the portion
of 1908 which is included. The increased volume of loans at five
and six per cent. is equally marked. The following table makes
this analysis clearer by showing the total borrowings of each year
and the percentage at each rate:</p>

<p>The foregoing table shows that while, in 1897, the railways borrowed
87.66 per cent. and in 1898, 97.91 per cent. of the new capital
obtained in the form of loans at four per cent. or better, they were
compelled, in 1907, to promise more than four per cent. on 70.24
per cent. and in the first six months of 1908 to promise six per cent.
on 43.00 of their borrowings. The significance of these figures

<p>The foregoing shows an increase, in the average interest rate
demanded upon new loans to railway corporations, from 3.90 per
cent. in 1897 to 4.62 in 1907 and 5.04 in 1908. The increase in the
rate from 1897 to 1907 was equal to 18.46 per cent. and from 1897
to 1908 it was 29.23 per cent. In other words, one dollar would
pay interest on as much of the new capital secured by loans in
1897 as $1.29 would of the loans of 1908. The gross revenue of
$105.00 obtained in both years from the typical shipment of fourth
class freight between Chicago and New York, at the unchanged
rate applicable to such a shipment in both years, would pay interest
on $2,692.31 secured in the earlier year and on only $2,083.33 secured
in the later year. The loss in power to purchase loaned capital
therefore amounts to 22.62 per cent. In order fully to appreciate
the importance of this rise in the cost of capital it is necessary to
realize that very great sums of new capital are annually required
for the necessary augmentation and improvement of railway facilities.
This is made evident by the total yearly borrowings as
shown in the foregoing tables, but it should be borne in mind that
further sums, certainly not less extensive in the aggregate, have
been raised through issues of stock, which promise no certain rate
of interest, although these sums could not have been obtained unless
the subscribers had considered it probable that they would, in the
long run, receive returns in dividends at least equal to the "going
rate" of interest. It is interesting to note that the aggregate of
new capital secured by loans in each year has very largely exceeded
the total interest payments to all capital obtained by bor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>rowing.
This is shown by the following table, the data in which,
except those as to the sums obtained by loans, are from the reports
of the Interstate Commerce Commission:</p>

<p class="pfs80">FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE PURCHASER OF THE SERVICES.</p>

<p>So far the extent and significance of the changes in the value,
or purchasing power, of money have been considered from the
point of view of those who produce and sell railway transportation.
But equally striking changes will appear and similar conclusions
are inevitable when recent history is reviewed in the
aspect which it presents to those whose earnings are devoted, in
part, to the purchase of the services which the railways supply. For
the important consideration to the wage-earner who wishes to
travel by rail or who buys commodities that have been so carried,
or to the producer whose products must go to market over railway
routes, is not, how much money must be paid for the railway services,
but, rather, how much labor must be expended, or what quantity
of his goods must be produced, in order to obtain that sum
of money. If the earnings of a particular wage-earner have increased
from fifty to seventy-two cents per hour, a railway service
is cheaper, to him, if it costs twelve cents than it was at ten cents
when his earnings were on the fifty-cent basis, for he now procures
with the fruit of ten minutes' toil what formerly cost the result of
twelve minutes' labor. In Bulletin No. 77, just issued by the United
States Bureau of Labor, the official statistician presents data showing
the relative wages per hour of many different classes of wage-earners,
not including railway employees, in 1897 and 1907. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
these data show that wages have almost uniformly advanced (there
are ten somewhat questionable exceptions among the 342 classes)
the data supplied by the Interstate Commerce Commission show
that during the same period average railway freight rates have declined
from 7.98 mills to 7.59 mills per ton per mile, or 4.89 per
cent. A table presenting and based upon these official statistics and
showing the relative wages per hour of the various classes of labor,
in 1897 and 1907, the percentage increase in wages rates per
hour and the increased command over railway freight services which
these wage-earners have obtained through the combined effect of
higher wages and lower ton-mile rates is given in Appendix C<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>.
In studying the data presented in this appendix it should be borne
in mind that the wages are relative and not absolute. They mean,
for example, that the average male blacksmith in the agricultural
implement industry was paid, in 1907, $1.25 for the same quality and
period of labor for which he was paid a little less than ninety-six
cents, in 1897. This increase amounted to 30.58 per cent. of the
wages rate of 1897, and, combined with a decreased cost of railway
freight service of 4.89 per cent., which made 95.11 cents go as far
in purchasing the latter in 1907 as one dollar would go in 1897,
gave him 37.29 per cent. greater command over railway freight
services.</p>

<p>In an earlier bulletin, No. 75, published during the current year,
the Bureau of Labor continued its "index numbers," which show,
in similar manner, the average relative wholesale prices of the
commodities entering into the ordinary budget of family expenditures.
For the purpose of presenting the changes in these prices
on a uniform basis the Bureau represents the averages for the
ten years from 1890 to 1899, inclusive, as one hundred per cent.
and reduces the averages for each year to percentages of the averages
for the basic period. The following table presents these figures
for the year 1897 to 1907, inclusive:</p>

<p>In considering the foregoing the fact that the prices relate solely
to animals on farms should be borne in mind. They are doubtless
somewhat lower than for animals elsewhere located, but prices
of the latter have probably moved in the same direction and in
about the same extent.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p class="pfs80">RAILWAY RATES IN 1897 AND AT PRESENT MEASURED IN MONEY.</p>

<p>Throughout the foregoing discussion reference has frequently
been made to what has been assumed to be a typical shipment, that
is, a fifteen-ton carload of fourth class freight transported between
Chicago and New York. The typical service rendered in moving
this shipment would have brought the railways gross receipts of
$105.00, in 1897 or in any of the intermediate years, and would
bring the same amount now. The period in question, however, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>witnessed many thousands of changes in railway rates on particular
commodities and between particular points, and, confining the
discussion for the present to the mere expression of rates in terms
of money, it is necessary to inquire whether the general level of
all rates has been raised or lowered and how far the change, if
any is discovered, has gone in either direction. Now, it is manifestly
impossible to correlate all rates in a single tabulation, and,
giving to each its proper weight in the determination of a final average,
thus establish definitely and with complete precision the relation
between the money rates of 1897 and those at the present time.
The number of different articles shipped and the great number of
different points at which each article may enter into the aggregate
of traffic movement or to which it may be destined, as well as
the elusive character of the factors which would indicate the relative
weight properly to be allowed to each separate rate, wholly
preclude the adoption of such a method. Fortunately, however,
American railway accountants long ago adopted a measure of traffic
movement, which was later officially sanctioned by its adoption
for the same purpose by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and
which, when compared with the gross receipts from freight service,
results in an average that throws great light upon the movement
or absence of movement in the general level of the rates charged.
When the weight of any shipment, expressed in tons, is multiplied
by the distance which it is carried, expressed in miles, the resulting
product gives a measure of the service performed, in units which
are designated as "ton-miles." When the ton-miles (or ton-mileage)
of all shipments are aggregated the total represents the sum of all
services. The result of dividing the revenue from a particular shipment
by its ton-mileage is the average rate per ton per mile for
that shipment and if the sum representing the aggregate gross receipts
from all railway freight services is divided by the aggregate
ton-mileage of those services the quotient obtained is the average
ton-mile rate for all services. During the period from 1897 to
1907 these data have been compiled annually by the Interstate
Commerce Commission under the direction of Professor Henry C.
Adams, its statistician. The average rates thus established are
given both for the United States as a whole and for each of ten
districts or groups. The following table shows these averages
as they are given in the successive annual statistical reports of the
Commission:</p>

<p>The foregoing shows that the average rates per ton per mile, expressed
in money, were lower in every group but one, as well as
in the whole country, in 1907 than they were in 1897. The average
for the whole country was lower in 1907 than in any other year
shown except the years 1898 to 1902, inclusive, and for three of
those years the difference was less than one-tenth of one mill. The
decrease in the general average from 1897 to 1907 was 4.89 per cent.
and the increase from 1899, the year of the lowest average, was
4.83 per cent.</p>

<p>So far as the quality of the ton-mile unit is affected by changes
in the geographical distribution of traffic the tendency between
1897 and 1907 was toward a higher quality, for traffic movement
grew more rapidly in the regions where rates are normally higher
than it did in the regions of lower rates. In the following statement
the groups used by the Interstate Commerce Commission are
arranged with the group in which ton-mileage increased most rapidly
from 1897 to 1907 at the top, the group that increased next most
rapidly in the second line, and so on to the group that increased
least rapidly at the bottom:</p>

<p>It will be noted from the foregoing that the group in which the
average rates were highest in both 1897 and 1907 shows the most
rapid increase in traffic movement and that, with few exceptions,
the regions of higher rates show more rapid augmentation of ton-mileage.
This is exactly what might have been anticipated, for the
highest average rates are usually to be found in the regions most
scantily populated and, as these regions are filling up and are therefore
those most rapidly growing in population and industry, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
naturally show the greatest relative increases in freight tonnage.
The only notable exception is furnished by New England, a region
of high development, but where traffic movement is largely of a
character which imposes higher average rates. In the following
table the traffic increase is given for the regions that had ton-mile
rate averages above and below the average for the whole country,
in 1897:</p>

<p>The region with rates above the average in 1897 had 45.23 per

<p>By dividing the aggregate of the products in the last column of
the foregoing by the total ton-mileage shown in the second column,
an average is obtained which represents the ton-mile rate that would
have resulted in 1907 had the traffic of each group in that year
moved in precisely the same volume in which it actually moved and
had the average rates in each group been exactly the same as they
were in 1897. This shows that, under the conditions assumed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
average ton-mile rate for the whole country would have been 8.10
mills or 0.12 mill higher than in 1897. This advance of 1.50 per
cent. would have been wholly due to the more rapid growth of
traffic in the regions of normally higher rates. The chief significance
of so small a change in so long a period is, really, to indicate
that the ton-mile unit, so far from being of rapidly changing character,
is actually, at least as far as it might be assumed to be affected
by changes in the location of traffic movement, a fairly stable
unit and thus an excellent measure of the rise or fall in rates.
Whether the same conclusion is to be derived from a study of the
changes in the proportion of the total movement made up of commodities
of different grades and naturally taking different rates is
now to be made the subject of inquiry.</p>

<p>Publication of the classified statistics of tonnage necessary for
such an inquiry was begun by the Interstate Commerce Commission
with the report for the year 1899. Consequently it is not practicable
to extend the inquiry to a period prior to that year. The following
statement shows the number of tons of freight of each of
the classes of commodities named which were received by the railways
for transportation in 1899, 1903 and 1907 and the proportion
of the tonnage in each class to the total number of tons carried:</p>

tons received for shipment regardless of the distance carried and,
in consequence, does not throw the light upon traffic movement
that would be available if it were possible to know the ton-mileage

convey some information as to the character of the ton-mile
unit during the different years and the nature of the changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>

<p>Obviously the effect of the increases shown in the foregoing upon
the quality of the average ton-mile must be in proportion as they
have exceeded or fallen short of the average increase shown at the
foot of the last column. There is no question that, in general,
products of agriculture, animals, forests and mines are low-grade
commodities, or that, on the other hand, the commodities classed as
manufactures, merchandise and miscellaneous are high-grade articles.
An increase in excess of the general average increase in the
first four classes named would tend to lower the quality of the
average ton-mile while the opposite effect, that is, a raising of the
quality, would result if the last three classes should increase more
rapidly than the increase in all tonnage. Adopting this classification,
the following shows the respective increases in high-grade and
low-grade tonnage:</p>

<p>The considerably greater increase in the tonnage of high-grade
articles indicated by the foregoing is scarcely within the possible
margin of error in the classification, but, in any event, what the
figures certainly prove is the absence of any actually far-reaching
change in the typical or average unit of traffic. That this conclusion
extends to traffic movement is clearly probable.</p>

<p class="pfs80">PRICES AND ACTUAL RATES.</p>

<p>Comparisons between actual prices of commodities shipped by
rail and typical freight charges on the same articles, for 1897 and
1907, demonstrate the fact that while prices have almost uniformly
advanced the greater number of rates have remained stationary
while among those which have changed the reductions are as numerous
as the advances and exceed the latter in extent and importance.</p>

<p>[Mr. McCain here presents a table compiled from reports of the
Bureau of Labor of the actual prices of commodities and the rates
between principal points of shipment, occupying pp. 50-58 of his
pamphlet.]</p>

<p>Examination of prices collected and reported by the Bureau of
Labor, giving the prices in 1899 and 1907 of 229 articles, shows that
among these 204 prices or 89.08 per cent. of the total were increased.
The rates on forty-nine of these articles were advanced
an average of 13.14 per cent. and the rates on forty-eight of them
were reduced an average of 16.44 per cent. Other conclusions are
shown in the following summary table:</p>

<p>The foregoing shows that while prices were advanced for 204
out of 229 articles, or 89.08 per cent. of the entire number included
in the table, the freight rates on the same articles, as expressed in
money, were advanced in but forty-nine instances, or 21.40 per
cent. of the total, money rates were reduced in forty-eight instances,
or 20.96 per cent. of the total, and remained stationary in 118 instances,
or 57.64 per cent. of the total. Of the rates advanced forty-four
were in cases in which the prices had also advanced, and of
the rates reduced forty-two applied to articles which had advanced
in price. Even as to the commodities which had advanced in price,
the average advance being over fifty-five per cent., money rates
were advanced in but forty-four instances out of 204 and the average
advance was but 13.77 per cent. and there were forty-two reductions
in money rates, such reductions averaging 16.86 per cent.</p>


<p class="pfs80">SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEPRECIATION OF MONEY.</p>

<p>It has now been fully demonstrated (first) that the railways
have to pay much more, probably not less on the average than
twenty-five per cent. more, for everything they require in the conduct
of their business, including labor, than they did ten years ago,
(second) that those who make use of railway services receive much
more, probably not less on the average than twenty-five per cent.
more, for their labor or for the commodities which they produce
than they did ten years ago, (third) that average rates per ton per
mile for railway freight transportation, expressed in money, that
is to say, in dollars and decimal fractions of dollars, are now somewhat
lower than they were in 1897 or formerly, and (fourth) that
the ton-mile unit is a highly stable one as to quality and that
in consequence of this stability the ton-mile rates accurately answer
the question whether rates, expressed in money, have remained
stationary, have advanced or have declined. The latter conclusion
has been supplemented and re-enforced by data from the
classifications and rate schedules which tend strongly to prove the
same fact. Therefore, it has been made plainly apparent that there
has been a decline in money rates since 1897. But railways require
money only to remunerate the highly skilled labor they employ, to
purchase necessary materials and supplies, to pay taxes and to
compensate the capital they use. Consequently money is worth to
the railway corporation, as to the wage-earner, only what it will
buy for the satisfaction of wants. A dollar which will pay for
less labor or buy less fuel for locomotives is worth less to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the railway just as a dollar that will buy less bread or clothing
is worth less to the man who works for wages or receives it
as interest on his savings. It has long been realized that any effort
to study the question of wages, throughout an extended period,
which fails to take into consideration the purchasing power of the
money received is worse than valueless, because it is deceptive
and misleading. It has been generally recognized also that any
effort to consider the condition of particular classes of producers by
comparisons of the prices obtained for their products at different
periods, as that of farmers by the prices of corn and wheat, is
similarly dangerous unless these prices are turned into quantities of
the commodities which such producers must purchase.</p>

<p>[In elucidating this obvious point Mr. McCain cites such authorities
as Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, President Hadley of
Yale, Professor Frank W. Taussig of Harvard, and then continues.]</p>

<p>A rapid decrease in the purchasing power of the money they
receive has brought about, within a single decade, a reduction in
railway freight rates that cannot be less than twenty-five per cent.
This reduction began almost imperceptibly at a time when American
railway rates were already lower than ever before in the history
of railways and lower than anywhere else in the world. It
has proceeded, concurrently with the fall in the real value (that
is in the purchasing power) of the American dollar, but in such
subtle form that only when its consequences threaten the stability
of the American railway system, the wages of railway employes
and the prosperity of the great rail-manufacturing, car-building
and other allied industries is its real significance and extent perceived
even by those most immediately interested. That such a
threat now hangs over the railway industry of America and every
employe and industry dependent upon it is too plain for argument.
The situation is acute and nothing but a prompt adjustment of the
rates obtained for the services rendered to offset, partially, at least,
the loss in the value of the money received will prevent disaster.
That such an adjustment, if effected now, will, at best, be tardy
and belated is evident from the facts herein presented, which show
that prices in every other industry and the wages of all artisans
were long ago adjusted to this fundamental condition.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RAILROADS_AND_PUBLIC_APPROVAL" id="THE_RAILROADS_AND_PUBLIC_APPROVAL"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE RAILROADS AND PUBLIC APPROVAL</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Edward P. Ripley</span><br />,
President Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company.</p>

<p class="center">Address delivered at the annual dinner of the Railway Business
Association, New York, November 10, 1909.</p>


<p>Circumstances over which I had no control caused me to be
born with a distinct inability to think consecutively, or talk coherently,
in a standing position and before an audience.</p>

<p>Seated on the small of my back with my feet on the desk I sometimes
think I am thinking, but when I get before an audience I
am like the little steamer plying on the Sangamon River that had
a 10-foot boiler and a 12-foot whistle&mdash;when she whistled she
stopped. But my weakness, or rather one of my weaknesses, is susceptibility
to flattery, and when one of your officers represented in
honeyed phrase the importance of your organization and of this
meeting, and laid particular stress upon the importance of my saying
something, I weakly yielded. I know the result will be disappointment,
but the responsibility is only partly mine, and you
know we railroad men get so little flattery that when properly administered
the result is intoxicating.</p>

<p>Also, let me state in extenuation of the crime I am about to
commit that the subject was not my own selection, but was chosen
for me. My natural disposition in discussing railroads and the
public is to growl, while, if I understand your officers' wishes, I
am here expected to "purr."</p>

<p>But while a better man might have been selected to say it, there
is much to be said as to the railroads and public opinion.</p>

<p>In this country the people rule&mdash;and in the long run that system,
that method or that personality that does not meet the approbation
of the public can not succeed. True, the public is often fooled; true,
it "gets on the wrong feet," as often perhaps as on the right; true,
it has to be guided, controlled, and at times abruptly stopped by
those authorities which it has selected for that purpose; yet the
fact remains that the government of the people, that Congress, the
legislatures and even the courts are keenly alive to public sentiment
and anxious not to stray far from the line of public opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Our forefathers recognized the danger that the majority would not
necessarily be right, but might often be wrong, and sought to provide
safeguards for the rights of the minority. But these safeguards are
obviously growing less efficient; obviously growing weaker; obviously
more sensitive to the public clamor which for the moment
stands for public opinion, and when all safeguards have been exhausted
it is to public opinion that we must look at last.</p>

<p>There are two things about which the public is most critical&mdash;one
is the management of the newspaper, the other the management
of the railroad. In his heart the average citizen believes that
he could operate either his daily newspaper or the railroad passing
through his town much better than it is being operated; he would
perhaps hesitate to announce this opinion, but his attitude is coldly
critical, and it is to be remembered that the railroad is all out of
doors&mdash;all out in the weather, everything about it exposed to the
limelight and visible to anybody's naked eye. There is no human
activity the operation of which is attended with so much publicity.
All our earnings and expenses are published; all our charges and
all our methods the subject of regulation, intelligent or otherwise.</p>

<p>Many years ago Mr. W. K. Vanderbilt, journeying to Chicago,
was met on the outskirts of the city by an enterprising reporter for
a daily paper, who boarded the train and forced himself into the
presence of Mr. Vanderbilt and his party, and demanded news on
behalf of "the public." Probably Mr. Vanderbilt, resenting the intrusion,
said something uncomplimentary to the reporter and possibly
to the "public" he claimed to represent, and the next issue of
that paper quoted him in scare headlines as using the phrase, "The
public be damned." Mr. Vanderbilt subsequently denied having
said it, but whether he did or not and whatever may have been his
provocation, the phrase has for nearly forty years been used as
indicative of the railway man's attitude toward his patrons.</p>

<p>Many years ago also the late George B. Blanchard, being on the
witness stand at Albany, was asked what was the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'correst'">correct</ins> basis
for making freight rates, and replied, "What the traffic will bear"&mdash;a
most excellent answer, but a most unfortunate one&mdash;for it has
passed into history as meaning "all the traffic will bear," which is a
very different thing.</p>

<p>Such things as these, distorted as they have been, conspired to
inflame public opinion, but that is not all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the custom and privilege of men past middle age to be
reminiscent and I ask your indulgence for a very brief history of
the events that have led us to our present status. My railroad experience
began about forty years ago and the railroad business was
then much like any other business&mdash;it had its price list as did the
merchant; but, like the merchant, it had its discounts for large shippers
and for special conditions, and the discounts were irregular
and various. The larger shippers demanded concessions as a right,
and the principle was generally admitted. Naturally the result was
favoritism, not because the railroads desired especially to favor
one as against another, but because in the nature of things secret
rates could not well be given to everybody.</p>

<p>Nobody regarded these secret rates as criminal or objectionable.
But as time passed and these discriminations became more frequent
and greater there arose a demand from the less favored portion
of the shipping community for legislation forbidding the discrimination
and providing for like opportunity for all. This was
strenuously opposed by the favored shippers and by those railroad
men who believed the railroad to be purely a private institution and
not amenable to law as to its charges. It was common enough to
hear it seriously argued that the larger shipper was entitled to the
lower rate&mdash;this view was held by many shippers and, I believe, by
most railroad managers. They argued that the business was like
any other business&mdash;that each interest must look out for itself, and
that competition between the roads would prevent rates from ever
being too high.</p>

<p>For myself I may say that I realized from an early period that
discrimination as to rates was unjust and at no time objected to
laws forbidding it.</p>

<p>The interstate commerce law was passed in 1887. It was crude
in its provisions and was the result of compromises between radicals
and conservatives; it sought both to foster competition and to
abolish it, and in that respect remains still contradictory and impossible.</p>

<p>Upon the passage of the law, that which had been looked upon
as perfectly proper and as the working of natural competitive forces
became illegal and criminal. The railroads generally accepted the
law and made an honest effort to observe it&mdash;the mercantile community
did not&mdash;indeed, they openly defied it, soliciting rebates unblushingly
and threatening with the loss of their tonnage those roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
who would not succumb. The Interstate Commission, new to its
duties, contented itself with comparatively unimportant decisions
and practically did nothing to help those railroads who desired honestly
to carry out the provisions of the law; and, as a result, within
a year of the passage of the law it was quite generally disregarded.
A few railroad men were fined, a few shippers convicted&mdash;and almost
immediately pardoned&mdash;and the law fell into disrepute, a condition
disgraceful alike to the government, the shippers and the
railroads and especially distasteful to the latter, but exactly what
was to be expected.</p>

<p>The result was the passage of the so-called Elkins bill, and later
the Hepburn bill, which, while amateurish and in many ways vicious,
have effectually stopped the rebate system&mdash;a result for which we
may all be thankful.</p>

<p>In all the controversies that have led up to this almost complete
control of railroad earnings and railroad policies by governmental
agencies, the railroads have, as a rule, acted in active opposition.
They have not been unanimous&mdash;some of us were willing to accept
it long before it became a fact, but the majority could see nothing
in it but disaster&mdash;it is too early to say which was right&mdash;perhaps
an earlier acceptance of control would have made the control more
lenient; perhaps its earlier acceptance would, on the other hand,
have bound the chains more tightly. But the fact remains that while
the basic principle of absolute equality as to rates has been accepted
by the railroads gladly and in all good faith, and they have also accepted
the principle of government regulation, the scars of the conflict
remain and a large section of the public still suspects and misjudges
us. It is true, of course, that in the rapid development of our
business and in the exigencies of a most exacting profession there
have been abuses and lapses, but I am here to maintain that the
standards of fair dealing and commercial honesty in our business
have been as high as in any other, and I appeal to you who sit around
this table to say if it be not so.</p>

<p>But whatever sins may be laid at our door, however much we
may have once believed that ours was a private business to be
controlled exclusively by its owners, however much we have resented
or still resent the interference of the public as manifested in
the various governing bodies, it is, after all, the public that is master
and we must all recognize it. It is, however, still our privilege to
exercise our right as citizens and members of the body politic to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
use our efforts to guide it. Acknowledging as we must that the public
is all-powerful, the question is, How may we satisfy our masters
and thus mitigate our woes and preserve our properties?</p>

<p>First. We must realize, as I think we all do (after a series of
very hard knocks), that the railroads are not strictly private property,
but subject to regulation by the public through its regularly
constituted authorities&mdash;that the Government may reduce our earnings
and increase our expenses has been sufficiently proved.</p>

<p>Second. To meet this situation we must endeavor to get in touch
with public opinion. Perhaps you will smile when I say that for
years I have read every article on railroad matters in each of the
papers published along our ten thousand miles of road&mdash;not an easy
task for a busy man&mdash;but while I have waded through much chaff
I am sure it has resulted in some reforms.</p>

<p>Third. The avoidance of action seriously counter to public opinion,
except for compelling reasons.</p>

<p>Fourth. The disposition to explain these reasons through officers
and employes of all grades. Generally, the loudest criticisms come
from those who are not anxious to know the truth.</p>

<p>Fifth. Efforts to improve service in many cases without hope of
reward and for the deliberate purpose of winning public approval,
such as better stations, improved heating and lighting devices, better
equipment, better terminal facilities, separation of grades, etc.&mdash;all
with due regard to the rights of those whose money we are spending.</p>

<p>As we do all these things, meet us half way. Encourage the
habit of not rushing into abuse. Try to consider the facts and the
difficulties&mdash;this is for the public interest as well as ours. Oppose
unnecessary and restrictive legislation and give us a chance.</p>

<p>Most of our railroads are mere imitations of what a railroad
should be, and what it must be to keep abreast of the country&mdash;yet
even the poorest serves a useful purpose and can not be spared.
An eminent authority has said that five thousand millions of dollars
would be required to supply the transportation needs of the
next decade, and I do not believe it is an over-estimate. Can private
capital be found to that amount unless "public sentiment" is willing
to assure it of return? A portion of the public is clamoring for
facilities involving great additions to expenses; another portion for
limitation of earnings; will the investor consent to accept the risks
while strictly limited as to his return? Since the public may do as
it will with us and since we are necessary to the public, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
properly call attention to the fact that railway investments already
pay less than any other line, and to ask what is to be done&mdash;really,
it is quite as much the public's affair as ours.</p>

<p>Is it certain that the mixture of private ownership and public
regulation which is now prevalent will succeed? Is it not contrary
to all rules of political economy and to all the teachings of history?
Starting as a purely private industry it has been appropriated in
part and other parts are apparently to follow. Granting whatever may
be claimed for the advantages of regulation by government, do not
equity and ordinary commercial decency require that such close
restriction and supervision should be accompanied by some guaranty
of return?</p>

<p>I have endeavored to sketch briefly what should be the attitude
of the railway man <em>as</em> a railway man toward the public. I am
sure I voice the sentiment of all managing railroad officers when
I say that our great desire is to please the public and to give it the
best possible service for the least possible compensation consistent
with reason. Discriminations have long since passed away and
nobody is better pleased than the railroad man that it is so. There
is no desire to escape either responsibility or regulation. We desire
to accord only justice and we ask in return only justice. May
I now, as a citizen, appeal to the railway employe, to the members
of this Association, and to all other good citizens, to resist to the
utmost of their powers the encroachment of government on private
rights?</p>

<p>Mr. Elbert Hubbard, of East Aurora, N. Y., recently remarked
that "when God sent a current of common sense through the universe
most of the reformers wore rubber boots and stood on glass."
Our troubles are with this class&mdash;well-meaning men who have zeal
without knowledge and enthusiasm without sanity; these we may
not reach, but the great mass of the solid and substantial citizenship
may perhaps be induced to stop and consider whither we are drifting
and whether this greatest of all the country's industries is being
fairly treated.</p>

<h2><a name="RAILROADS_AND_THE_PUBLIC" id="RAILROADS_AND_THE_PUBLIC"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">RAILROADS AND THE PUBLIC</a></h2>

<p class="center smcap">By Hon. John C. Spooner.</p>

<p class="center">From the address delivered at the annual dinner of the Railway
Business Association, New York, November 10, 1909.</p>


<p>The topic which has been assigned to me is brief, but very large:
"Railroads and the Public." It suggests nothing of humor, but
everything of gravity and involves considerations which affect the
prosperity of our whole people. The railroads, often berated in
legislatures and in congresses as <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'leachlike'">leechlike</ins> and piratical, are, after all,
vital to the happiness of our people and to the progress of our industries
and commerce. The people are apt to forget that they have
been the greatest factors&mdash;I say the <em>greatest</em> factors&mdash;in the development
of our resources and the enlargement of our commerce, both
in times of war and in times of peace. If one would stop to think
of what would have happened if, during the war for the preservation
of the Union, we had been without railroads, ready and willing
to serve the government upon its demand and at prices fixed by it,
how long would the war have continued? And what might not
have been its result? They carried troops from the North to the
places of rendezvous in the fields; they enabled the government to
transfer quickly from the East to the West, or the West to the
East, as emergency demanded, troops essential to successful military
operations. They carried munitions of war, they carried the mail
to our soldiers, they carried food and raiment to those who were
fighting under our flag.</p>

<p>And in time of peace, what would this country have been without
the railroads? The railroad has been the advance courier of
progress, of settlement, of production, of commerce. It is absolutely,
and has been, indispensable to the government, to the commerce
and to the happiness and comfort of our people. Its mission
is not performed or fulfilled. Considered solely with reference
to construction, there are new fields to be penetrated by them. Today
men of courage and men of means are building railways with
characteristic American energy in far off Alaska, to bring the gold
mines and the coal mines and the timber and the unknown resources
of that distant territory into the markets of the United States. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
there is one instrumentality which above another has been a factor,
appreciable by all thoughtful men, in making this country what it
is, it is the railroad. And the railroad has kept abreast with the
demands of commerce. Every device which ingenuity or invention
has presented has been promptly adopted by the railway companies
of the country. They have kept abreast of invention and
improvement, until today the railway system of the United States
is the most luxurious, the safest, the best managed railway system
under the bending sky.</p>

<p>The first thing that would occur to one from this toast, the railroads
being first mentioned, is what do the railroad companies owe
to the public? That is easily defined. They owe it to the public to
furnish safe roadbeds and equipment; they owe it to the public to
furnish prompt service; they owe it to the public to treat all men,
with obvious limitations, passengers and shippers under the same
circumstances, equally and without unjust discrimination, and they
owe to the public the duty of, as far as it is possible, so maintaining
their roads and their equipment as to be able to meet in a fair way
all the demands of commerce and traffic at reasonable rates. That
excludes the rebate which never had any justification in logic or in
fair play. I think those who hated it most were those who felt
obliged to adopt it. When one railway company gave rebates it is
quite manifest that the competitor was obliged to, or go out of
business. And I believe that railway companies of the United
States were glad, and their officers were glad, when it was made a
penal offense for railway companies to give rebates. I think a railway
company owes to the public to be careful in the selection of
its employes; they should be capable, of course, and they should not
only be capable, but they should be courteous and polite. To sum it
up, you would say that what the railway in the enlarged sense&mdash;which
includes details&mdash;owes to the public is just and fair treatment.</p>

<p>What does the public owe to the railway companies? Precisely, as
I view it, the same thing, just and fair treatment. Only that and
nothing more. Everybody knows that the railway companies of the
United States&mdash;I won't put it that way&mdash;that the railway system of
the United States never could have been created without the utilization
of corporate entities. Partnerships never could have concentrated
the capital necessary to that end. Only corporations could
have achieved it. That was true in the past and it always will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
true. Now, why is the railway company different from other corporations,
most other corporations? One trouble with the general
public is that they don't seem to understand&mdash;and they are not perhaps
to be chided for it&mdash;their relation to the railway company.
They think, and they are told, they have been told it in Congress,
and they have been told it where one would least have expected
it, that railway corporations are public corporations, and they have
been taught to believe that their power over public corporations was
supreme, which is not far from the truth; but the railway corporation
is not a public corporation. The Supreme Court has many
times decided that a railway company is a private corporation, that
its property is private property, under the protection and safeguards
of the Constitution of the United States against the public as well as
against individuals who attack it. Then, wherein lies the difference
between a private corporation engaged in manufacture and a railway
corporation? Right here: A railway corporation can not
construct its railway without being clothed with a power which is not
given to the usual private corporation, a power which inheres in
the sovereignty of the state, the ultimate power of the people delegated
to the railway corporations and very few others, and that is
the power to take your land without your will at a price fixed not
by you but by a jury. Why? Because it is for the public use, and
private interest and private sentiment can not be permitted to obstruct
the interest of the state, and therefore the property of a
railway company while it is private property is, as the Supreme
Court of the United States has said, affected with the public interest.</p>

<p>A railway company serves the public, that is what it is organized
to do. Those who apply for the corporate franchises do not apply
for an altruistic purpose. They wish it because they think they can
make profit out of it, and that is legitimate, but the state grants it
for the public use. And so it comes about that the state has the
power to regulate it. Mark what I say, to regulate it, to prevent it
from exacting extortionate rates from the people; to prevent it
from putting upon the people abuses in its management, but that
does not mean that the state may take its property. That does not
mean that the state may take its management out of the hands of
its owners. It means simply that the state may protect the public
from any abdication by it or violation by it of its duty as a common
carrier, and this principle is too often forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>In these days regulation has apparently achieved a wider field
for operation, and is deemed to be broad enough to regulate not only
the property and the management of the property, but
the management of everybody connected with it. That
won't do. Why, I see it is stated in the report of your Business
Association that commissions which have been organized by the
states and the Commission organized under the act of Congress,
have come to stay. Of course they have come&mdash;we know that, and
we know another thing, that whenever a governmental commission
comes, it stays. The commissions in the states, most of the
states&mdash;God knows I wish I could say all the states, but I can not
truthfully&mdash;have subserved a useful purpose. The state lays down
the rule and the commission administers the law. There is one thing
about a commission in the regulation under the law of railway carriers
which places it in respect of proprietary, fairness and fitness
for that function, far above Congress or any other legislative body,
and that is this: That they have time to listen, to investigate, to
get at the truth, which a legislative body does not have time to do in
the very nature of things. I do not know, but I think nothing added
more to the reputation of Governor Charles E. Hughes, of New
York, than the fact that he refused to sign a bill, but vetoed it, reducing
the rates which railway companies might charge, upon the
ground that there had been no investigation which enabled fair
judgment as to what was fair treatment to the railway corporations.</p>

<p>I was in public life a good many years and I am a firm believer in
the sober second thought of the American people, for it represents
the average judgment of every class of our people; but they get
wrong, they get wrong about men, and they get wrong about policies
and measures. They are subject, en masse, as men are individually,
to moments of passion and excitement, and they know
it. As Mr. Webster said, and as the Supreme Court of the United
States has said, the fundamental object of a constitution adopted by
the people is that they may protect themselves against themselves
in moments of excitement and passion. And the American people
will always give heed to the popular translation of the phrase, "Due
process of law," that is, hear before you strike.</p>

<p>Now the Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, was
intended by the Congress which created it to be an absolutely independent
body. It was to report to the Congress, it was not to be
subject to the command of either House of Congress, or of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Executive of the United States. It was intended to be a quasi-judicial
body. I know all of its members, and I do not depreciate
to the slightest extent the services which it has rendered. The only
criticism I would have of it, and that does not arise from its membership,
but it is inherent in the system, is that it is never satisfied
with the powers it has got. It is as insatiable as death for power.
It has been proposed that they shall have the power to regulate
the issue of stocks and bonds by railway corporations created by the
states, that is, if the state which creates the railway company authorizes
it, desiring it to utilize its privileges for the construction of
a new railroad, to issue stock, or issue bonds, that it shall not be
permitted to do that thing until the act of the legislature and the
approval of the governor shall have been supplemented by the approval
of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Now I am getting
along in years, and I am a little old-fashioned, and I have not yet
been able to satisfy myself that where one government creates a
stock corporation, another government shall regulate the amount of
its capital stock and its bonded indebtedness.</p>

<p>I have seen it proposed lately that the Commission should have
the power to fix a rate, and that that rate should be final until a
final judgment setting it aside was reached. What becomes of the
constitution under such a law as that? A railway company, as I have
said, owns its property. It renders a compulsory service to the
public over its own property, with its own equipment, with its own
employes, and at its own risk, and is entitled to a fair compensation,
based upon the fair value of the property which it devotes to
the public convenience, and the Supreme Court has held that that
property can not be taken&mdash;because the use of property is the property&mdash;can
not be taken for the public use without just compensation,
and if the state, the legislature, or the Congress may authorize a
commission to fix a rate as reasonable and fair, beyond which the
railway company may not charge for services it renders, and require
it to observe that rate until the final adjudication as to whether the
rate is reasonable or not, and after the lapse of months it is decided
that it was unreasonable, how can the railway company recover
the great sum in unreasonable rates which it had lost? It
is a taking of a private property for a public use without just compensation,
and I deny the constitutional power of Congress to do
that thing. I admit the power, and the exercise of it to the fullest
extent to so far regulate railway corporations as to secure to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
public a faithful discharge of all their duties to the public at reasonable
rates, and under fair regulations; beyond that I believe
that the owners of the property ought to be permitted to manage
the property.</p>

<p>The business of railway management has become one of the
learned professions. It calls for some of the brightest intellects in
the country. It calls for the exercise of powers which, if devoted
to the law or to finance or to any other business, would place
those who exercise it among those at the head. It is one of infinite
complication, and it is not to be supposed that railway commissions
can manage railway properties as well as the men who have
been trained from boyhood to that business. I have never questioned
that the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Commission
in Wisconsin, and other commissions, earnestly set out to do the
just and fair thing, but the trouble with this whole question is,
and has been through many a year, that it gets too often into politics.
I do not believe myself that questions of business ever ought
to find their way into the political platform of the party, any more
than I believe that the relations of the employer to the employe,
whatever the business may be, ought to become the football of party
politics.</p>

<p>This Association was born out of a happy inspiration. I think
these troublesome problems are approaching solution. The railway
companies must obey the law. The people ought to see to it
that the law which the railway corporations are obliged to obey is a
just law, and that is to be ascertained only on painstaking inquiry,
and not through the speeches of enthusiastic orators or on the floors
of Congress. It has got to be at times that where there was no
other issue upon which a political contest could be fought out, the
easy, obvious and last resort was "let us go for the railroads," or,
as a Governor of Minnesota once expressed it, "Let's shake the
railroads over hell." The truth is that the interest of the railroads
is the interest of the people. The railroad company is dependent
upon the people for its life and its sustenance, and the people are
no less dependent upon the railway company, and between the two
there should be even-handed justice. They should be dealt with
calmly, and legislation should only follow deliberation and investigation,
and a law once enacted should be impersonally enforced, not
enforced against some and left to fall into <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'inocuous'">innocuous</ins> desuetude as
to others.</p>

<h2><a name="RAILROAD_PROBLEMS_OF_TODAY" id="RAILROAD_PROBLEMS_OF_TODAY"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">RAILROAD PROBLEMS OF TODAY</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. B. Thayer</span>,<br />
Vice-President Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</p>

<p class="center">Address delivered before the Traffic Club of New York, Saturday
Evening, February 16, 1909.</p>


<p>Problems&mdash;both many and varied&mdash;have always confronted the
railway manager. Particular problems come to the front from time
to time that tax all of our resources. They differ with different
periods of our history. Today one of the most serious depends
more for its solution upon our lawmaking bodies, both State and
national, than upon the railroad men, and for the present, at least,
we must feel like the old Arkansas darky, who said he was "in the
hands of an all-wise and unscrupulous Providence."</p>

<p>In the early days of railroads the chief problem was that of
construction and equipment; later, when more railroads had been
built than there was traffic to feed, there came the traffic problem,
and all the abuses which followed in its train. These, in turn,
led to the legislative problem accompanied by the Interstate Commerce
Law of 1887, and through the '90s all sorts of problems&mdash;including
bankruptcy for many. Now, within the past few years
has come the great problem of enlargement&mdash;the construction
period again, but in a different shape. Not experimental, for we
had learned how to build and how to equip; not the building so
much into new country, but to take care of the traffic which was
overflowing our rails.</p>

<p>Events of the past year have proved the absolute necessity for
almost all the large railroads in this country to enlarge their trackage,
their terminals, and their equipment; and yet, here again,
when in considering where to obtain the necessary funds for such
purposes,&mdash;which must, of course, come from the public,&mdash;the railroad
managers find themselves confronted with great difficulties.
This, of course, is largely due to the tremendous demands for
capital, in the development that is going on in all parts of the
world, but it is increased, at the moment, by the natural timidity of
capital to invest its funds in railroad securities, in view of the violent
attacks that are being made against corporations through Congress
and the State legislatures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>


<p class="pfs80">POPULAR HOSTILITY TO THE RAILROADS.</p>

<p>This brings us, then, to our greatest and most perplexing problem&mdash;that
of how to restore a state of reciprocal understanding and
fairness between the carriers and the public. Many railroad officials
believe that so deep-seated is the apparent hostility of the
people that the management of the railways will be taken practically
out of the hands of their owners, and that great disasters
are to follow. I do not share this view, principally for the reason
that whatever may have been the faults in the past, the methods
and practices of railroad management are now based upon a decent
regard for their public responsibilities. Sooner or later the people
will recognize this&mdash;as I believe they are already beginning to do.
But by no means can we minimize the actual situation of today. It
is, indeed, a time of great anxiety to all those entrusted with railroad
management, and who have the interests of their country at
heart as well.</p>

<p>With the old rebates and secret discriminations things of the
past, with all kinds of business in a most prosperous condition, we
all know that within the past three years, suddenly, out of an
almost cloudless sky, there has burst forth upon the railroads of
this country a torrent of the most bitter and violent attacks&mdash;by
political orators upon the stump; in magazines and newspapers; in
Congress and State legislatures. It is fair to say, I think, that this
onslaught had its origin in the agitation of 1904 for changes in
the Interstate Commerce law. It was based upon a misunderstanding
of existing railroad conditions and the position of the
railroad in regard to the points at issue, which I shall presently
explain.</p>

<p>Following the agitation surrounding the passage of the rate bill
has come a swarm of bills in Congress and State legislatures, which,
if they become laws, and are enforced, will prove disastrous to the
railroads, and, equally so, to the public at large. The question is,
What is to be done to prevent it? The old method of influence has
been abandoned, and, I hope, forever. Has it left us unequipped to
meet the issue? To answer this question let us get a perspective.</p>


<p class="pfs80">RAILROADS NOT BLAMELESS.</p>

<p>We must not imagine, to begin with, that we are entirely blameless.
We are in some respects only realizing the wages of past
sins. We have done many of "those things which we ought not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to have done," and we have left undone many of "those things
we ought to have done." Most of the evils date back many years
and many of them might have been prevented had the government
done its duty and enforced the law. Yet even in most recent
years we can find some mistakes with which to concern ourselves.
It is not strange that many men who have suffered loss through delays
in their traffic, or in their personal transportation, or who saw
themselves deprived of profitable business because they could not
secure cars, should have become exasperated and, not having time to
properly analyze the difficulty, thought that the railroads were lacking
in foresight and management.</p>

<p>But let us go back a few years. It is a great mistake to hold
the railroads responsible for such practices as rebating in those
days, when it would have been impossible to throw a stone in a
commercial community without hitting somebody who was taking
rebates and wanting more. Many men are today running for office
on anti-railroad platforms who if you were to say "Rebates" would
duck their heads very much as David Harum said his Newport
friends would do if he called out "Low bridge!" That rebates
were wrong nobody questions, but to pillory a man today for
accepting rebates at that time is a farce.</p>

<p>Many persons believe that the so-called discriminations, resulting
in the secret arrangements, were largely influenced by the desire
upon the part of railroad officials to favor one man against another,
but no thoughtful man who has at all studied the problem believes
this. Rebates and other forms of discrimination,&mdash;whatever may
have been the result in specific instances,&mdash;had their origin mainly
in the competition between carriers for the traffic. Incidentally, in
transacting railroad business through secret arrangements, as became
the custom in that period, there were many cases of discrimination
in favor of the strong and against the weak.</p>

<p>There was a strong feeling upon the part of many men, both in
and out of railway service, that the larger shipper, under the ordinary
rules of business, was entitled to a lower rate, and they could
not conceive the real principle which should govern the making of
railroad rates,&mdash;which, however, has come clearly to be realized
since that time. The railroad systems, generally, were not more
anxious to pay rebates than they were to pay higher prices for their
supplies, and simply pursued the course of their competitors because,
otherwise, they saw nothing but loss and probable bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>ruptcy
staring them in the face. The railroads were forbidden by
law to meet and make formal agreements for the maintenance of
rates, and by another law were required to compete. We all
thought that the old plan <em>was</em> competition.</p>

<p>Had the Government, through its Interstate Commerce Commission,
vigorously undertaken to enforce the law&mdash;passing if necessary,
long before it did, the Elkins Act&mdash;I think we should have
seen a correction of these abuses long before the reform came;
but, as a matter of fact, neither the Government authorities nor
many of those managing the railroads had yet reached a clear
conception of the significance of the abuses which existed and of
the proper legal method of uprooting those evils.</p>


<p class="pfs80">GETTING AWAY FROM OLD ABUSES.</p>

<p>Upon the resumption of business activity, in 1898 and 1899, and,
later, following the passage of the Elkins Act, the opportunity was
presented,&mdash;and in general accepted by the railroads,&mdash;to get away
from the old methods. While since then there have been some
cases of violation of the law, in the matter of secret arrangements,
yet I think that, at least within the last four or five years, it is
safe to say that they have been of small importance, and perhaps,
in many of the cases&mdash;while a technical violation of the law&mdash;were
actually not discriminations. I say this advisedly, so far as the
eastern situation is concerned, because I know that the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company has not paid a rebate for years, and it is
fair to believe that as that company held its traffic,&mdash;in fact, largely
increased it,&mdash;without the necessity for such arrangements, its competitors
must have to a large extent pursued the same policy.</p>

<p>But not alone in reference to freight rates was there more or
less complicity in evil between the people and the railroads, but
let me ask you to consider, for a moment, the question of free
transportation, or passes,&mdash;whether political or business. It is only
within the last year or two that the public conscience has been
awakened on this subject. It is true, the railroads have been
abused for several years by those who did not enjoy such favors,
but is the railroad more responsible for the conditions that existed
than the Government of the people, either in the National Congress
or in the State legislatures, and how could it be expected
that the legislators in one State could feel that they were doing very
wrong in accepting passes, when the legislators of another State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
enjoyed them by law of the State? How could members of Congress
be criticised for accepting such privileges, or the railroads
for extending them, when the Presidents of the United States
and member of their cabinets, and other important officers of the
Government not only accepted them, but practically exacted them,
and, further, expected that private cars and private trains should
be furnished without charge? Upon one occasion within the past
two years I called upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to
ask its assistance in eliminating the pass abuse, and was very frankly
told that it could make no move, nor take any interest in the
subject, in view of the fact that important public officials including
Senators and the members of Congress felt that it was not improper
for them to accept them. Out of this situation grew a large
part of the pass abuse, because, following the national government
and the legislatures, the large men of business felt that they could
properly accept similar privileges.</p>

<p>Therefore, I repeat, that while there were great abuses&mdash;especially
during the period referred to&mdash;embittering a large portion of
people, yet the railroads were no more responsible than the people
themselves; and yet, without doubt it was during this period that
the foundation was laid for the feeling of the present day.</p>


<p class="pfs80">RAILWAYS WELCOME JUST REGULATION.</p>

<p>But, as I stated, we were forced to bear the brunt of our past
sins&mdash;and more&mdash;in the campaign for increasing the powers of the
Interstate Commerce Commission. Do not misunderstand me.
Many thoughtful railroad men believed always, in the value, both
to the railroads and the public, of an interstate law, and, further,
considered it wise to strengthen the power of the Commission. The
distinction, however, between what railroad men did and did not
believe in, is very clear. We felt and we feel now that the government
is perfectly justified in regulating railroad practices to the
extent of preventing discriminations. Indeed, the government
should act as a sort of policeman to see to it that the weak and
the helpless are protected. If reasonably administered, the railroads
need the law. But the government should not have the right
to interfere with the proper play of the natural commercial forces
of the nation. The great distinction between police and commercial
powers should never be lost sight of.</p>

<p>The danger does not lie in the provisions of the new national
law. There is no substantial difference between its provisions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
those of the old law, except in respect to the powers of the Commission.
There was no necessity for the new law, so far as the
prevention of the old abuse of secret rates and discrimination was
concerned. The operation of this law does not involve any material
change in traffic operations of the railroads; the only danger
is as to how the Commission may exercise their power in influencing
reductions in rates, but even in that respect the railroads have
the right of appeal to the courts. It is from various other bills
being presented in Congress in which the immediate danger lies,
showing possible interference by the national government with the
operation of railroads, with respect to the hours of labor of its
employes, systems of signals, and other methods of operation,
which should properly be left to the railroads themselves. This
threatened interference of the federal government is having a
powerful and dangerous influence upon the legislatures of the various
states, who apparently are&mdash;in a slang term&mdash;"Seeing Congress
and going them five or six better"&mdash;in the bills for reduction of
state rates, both passenger and freight; for increase in taxation,
and all sorts of measures which tend to reduce the earnings and
increase the expenses, and hamper and delay the actual development
necessary.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that in the agitation and discussion following
the President's recommendations, until the present law was finally
adopted, there was a total misunderstanding upon the part of the
public at large as to this attitude of the railroads. It was most
unfortunate in that campaign that the principal point of contest
upon the part of the railroads was lost sight of&mdash;and that is&mdash;the
objection upon their part not to reasonable amendments to the law,
and not&mdash;if the people wanted it&mdash;to some increase of power to
the Commission, but to the attempt to make a commission of five
or seven men&mdash;in many respects a political body&mdash;the final arbiters
as to the rates and fares of the railroads.</p>


<p class="pfs80">DIFFICULTIES UNDER THE PRESENT LAW.</p>

<p>Yet even with the new law on the statute books, our traffic
problems are still with us. We are forbidden by law to make
formal agreements as to rates, yet it is universally recognized that
in order to secure an equitable adjustment of rates, it is absolutely
necessary that the traffic managers of the railroads shall confer frequently.
It is well known that such conferences are held and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
be held to prevent discriminations, yet no definite agreements can
be made.</p>

<p>The present law stipulates that there shall be no discrimination
by railroads against persons or communities. Right here, however,
the railroads are face to face with a problem all their own,
which is a very serious one, and that is: How shall a particular
railroad prevent discrimination against a community on its own
line by some other railroad seeking to specially favor a community
on its line? Is it not absolutely essential that there should be both
an understanding and a virtual agreement on the part of the two
railroads concerned for the purpose of protecting both communities?</p>

<p>Cases of dispute between railroads as to proper rate adjustments
have, indeed, been referred to Interstate Commerce Commissioners
as arbitrators and their findings have been observed. This
shows how absolutely vital to all business is the necessity for that
co-operation which can only be secured by agreement and conference
between all interested parties. The President of the United
States recognized the necessity for this fact in his last annual message
and recommended that some legislation be passed which would
permit agreements between railroads as to rates.</p>

<p>We are thus in the presence of this ridiculous situation; that on
the one hand we are being threatened with prosecution by the Government
for violation of the Sherman Act in respect to methods
which on the other hand the President of the United States and
the Interstate Commerce Commissioners agree must be followed
in order to properly discharge our responsibility to the public&mdash;in
other words, we are "between the devil and the deep sea," or we
are damned if we do, or we are damned if we don't.</p>

<p>So much for the moment, for our national problem. As to State
regulation: while not believing&mdash;now that we have a national law&mdash;that
it is necessary or desirable for the public to establish state
commissions and special railroad laws, at the same time, if the people
desire such commissions, we have no right to look upon such a
demand as "anarchistic," but we feel that the working of such
commissions will be unsatisfactory to the business interests.</p>


<p class="pfs80">CONFIDENCE AND JUSTICE NEEDED.</p>

<p>These are but a few of our problems and difficulties. While I
do not wish to minimize the dangers of the present situation, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
I recognize that it is now to some extent, by adding to the timidity
of investors, retarding our ability to secure funds necessary to
make extensions and buy equipment required for the ever-increasing
traffic of the country, and if continued will make it impossible,
yet I am firmly of the opinion that the good sense of the people
will prevail and the unjust attacks cease. Confidence of investors
both here and abroad is needed to furnish funds, and, if this is
seriously shaken, the prosperity of the railroads, which are the keystone
of the arch of business, will be destroyed.</p>

<p>To avoid these dangers a regime of confidence and fairness on
the part of the public toward the railroads must be restored, and
to accomplish this we must place our case, as it were, before the
legislators and the people and make clear our difficulties and the
complications which beset us. Few, after all, understand the railroad
problem, and we have not made it plain to the people, either
because it was the fashion not to do so, or because we could not
realize that things simple to us were not understood by the public.
We must not stop at one statement, but discourse upon and elucidate
every subject which the public misunderstands.</p>

<p>Let us be frank and take the public into our confidence as fully
as is consistent with the proper conduct of our business. Let us
approach the subject with the feeling that the railroads are not
absolutely perfect, that we have to some extent brought this condition
of affairs upon ourselves, and that we should govern ourselves
in the future accordingly. Let us undertake to go frankly
before the people and present the actual facts in connection with
our affairs.</p>


<p class="pfs80">THE PENNSYLVANIA AS AN ILLUSTRATION.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate: The Pennsylvania Legislature is in session.
Numerous bills have been presented, of a most radical nature. It
is our purpose to appear before every committee that will hear us,
and tell our side of the story. I doubt very much if the average
legislator&mdash;and certainly not the average citizen&mdash;understands
whom he is injuring in unjust acts towards the railroads. Take
our company, for example. It is not a small group of rich capitalists;
it is not Mr. McCrea and myself and a few others; the
Pennsylvania Railroad is owned by more than 50,000 people, 30
per cent of whom live in Pennsylvania. Forty-seven per cent of
our shareholders are women; and in many cases the dividend is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
their only source of income. Then there are thousands of bondholders;
beyond them are nearly 100,000 employes in the State of
Pennsylvania dependent upon the prosperity of the Pennsylvania
Railroad for their livelihood.</p>

<p>Therefore, by the usual computation, it is safe to say that approximately
half a million people&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;are actually
dependent upon the welfare of this company in the State of
Pennsylvania alone.</p>

<p>Upon the Pennsylvania Railroad's prosperity depends the prosperity
of the other lines in its system, and including the employes
of these lines, there are 200,000 men, who, with their families, constitute
an army of a million or more. Behind them, again, are the
thousands of men, with their families, who produce the coal and
other materials which the railroads use. Anything that cripples the
railroads injures every one of these people.</p>

<p>When we make these and other facts plain, I cannot but feel
that no injustice will be done. In the meantime, let us keep our
minds well balanced, and not allow ourselves to believe that chaos
is coming; let us meet the issue fairly and squarely and frankly.
While, therefore, necessary for the present, at least, to suspend
many improvements, let us keep our courage, trusting to the ultimate
good sense of the lawmakers and the people for that sympathy
and support to which we feel that we are entitled.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RELATION_OF_RAILROADS_TO_THE" id="THE_RELATION_OF_RAILROADS_TO_THE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE RELATION OF RAILROADS TO THE
STATE.</a></h2>

<p class="center smcap">By W. M. Acworth, M. A.</p>

<p class="center">Delivered before the British Association at Dublin, Ireland, September
2, 1908.</p>


<p>I propose to treat the subject in two aspects; first, the history
in outline of the relations between railroads and the state in different
countries, and, second, the question of the factors which are of
primary importance in any consideration of the matter.</p>

<p>Ever since the year 1830, when the dramatic success of the
Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway first revealed to a generation
less accustomed than our own to revolutionary advances in material
efficiency the startling improvements in transport that railroads were
about to effect, theorists have discussed the question whether state
or private ownership of railroads be in the abstract the more desirable.
But it is safe to say that in no country has the practical
question, "Shall the state own or not own the railroads?" been
decided on abstract considerations. The dominant considerations
have always been the historical, political and economic position of
the particular country at the time when the question came up in
concrete shape for decision.</p>


<p class="pfs80">BELGIUM.</p>

<p>The Belgian railroads have belonged to the state from the outset,
because they were constructed just after Belgium separated
from Holland, and (the available private capital being in Holland
and not in Belgium) King Leopold and his Ministers felt that, if
the railroads were in private hands, that would mean in Dutch
hands, and the newly acquired independence of Belgium would be
thereby jeopardized. Within the last few years this history has
repeated itself, and the fact that the bulk of the Swiss railroad
capital was held in France and Germany was one main reason, if not
<em>the</em> main reason, which induced the Swiss people to nationalize their
railroads.</p>


<p class="pfs80">GERMANY.</p>

<p>In Germany 70 years ago the smaller states were regarded as
the personal property of their respective Sovereigns, almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
definitely as Sutherlandshire is the property of the Duke of Sutherland.
And it was therefore as natural that the Dukes of Oldenburg
or Mecklenburg should make railroads for the development of
their estates as that the Duke of Sutherland should build a railroad
in Sutherland.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AUSTRALASIA.</p>

<p>Take, again, Australasia. In that region the whole of the railroads,
with negligible exceptions, now belong to the different state
governments, and the public sentiment that railroads ought to be
public property is today so strong that it is impossible to imagine
any serious development of private lines. But at the outset the traditional
English preference for private enterprise was just as strong
there as it was at home, and it was only the fact that the whole of
the available private capital was absorbed in the development of
the gold fields and that, therefore, if railroads were to be built at all,
public credit must be pledged and English capital must be obtained,
that caused the state to go into the railroad business.</p>


<p class="pfs80">ITALY.</p>

<p>Take, once more, the case of Italy. In the days when Italy was
only a geographical expression, the various Italian states experimented
with railroad management of all sorts and kinds. When,
after 1870, Italy was unified, it was necessary to adopt a national
railroad policy, and the Italian government instituted an inquiry
whose exhaustiveness has not since been approached. The force
of circumstances has indeed already compelled the government to
acquire the ownership of the railroads, but the Commission reported
that it was not desirable that the government should work them.
The railroads were accordingly leased for a period of 60 years,
running from 1884, to three operating companies, and it was provided
that the leases might be broken at the end of the 20th or the
40th year. From the very outset a condition of things developed
which had not been contemplated when the leases were granted, and
for which the leases made no provision. Constant disputes took
place between the government and their lessees. Capital for extensions
and improvements was urgently needed; neither party
was bound to find it; and agreement for finding it on terms mutually
acceptable was impossible of attainment. In the end the government
has been forced to cut the knot, to break the lease at the end
of the first 20 years' period, and for the last two years the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
government has operated its own railroads. But it is safe to say
that an <em>a priori</em> preference for state management over private management
played but scant part in the ultimate decision.</p>


<p class="pfs80">GENERAL INCREASE OF STATE CONTROL.</p>

<p>It is impossible to review, even in the merest outline, the railroad
history of all the countries in the world, but the instances already
given will serve to illustrate my proposition that the position in each
country depends not on abstract considerations, but on the practical
facts of the local situation. Yet one cannot look round the world
and fail to recognize that the connection between the railroads
and the state is everywhere becoming more intimate year by year.
Whatever have been the causes, the fact remains that Italy and
Switzerland have converted their railroads from private to public.
In Germany the few remaining private lines are becoming still
fewer. In Belgium the process is practically completed. In Austria
it is moving steadily in the same direction; four-fifths of the total
mileage is now operated by the state. In Russia the story would
have been the same, had it not been for the war with Japan. Even
in France, whose railroads have a very definite local and national
history of their own, an act for the purchase of the Western Railway
by the state was passed last year by the Chamber of Deputies,
and has now, after much contention, been passed by the Senate
within the last few weeks. But it is not without interest to note
that, though a majority both of deputies and of senators supported
the bill, the representatives of the district served by the company
were by a large majority opposed to it, while the commercial community
of the whole of France, as represented by the Chambers of
Commerce, were almost unanimously hostile.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> So far as can be
seen at present, the purchase of the Western Railway by the state
is not likely to be made a precedent for the general nationalization
of the French railroads. Still, the broad fact remains that a series
of railroad maps of the continent of Europe, constructed at intervals
of ten years, would undoubtedly show an ever-increasing proportion
of state lines, and that the last of the series would exhibit
the private lines as very far below the state lines both in extent
and in volume of traffic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>A word ought to be said of Holland, not only because Holland
is a country with free institutions like our own, but because the
railroad position of Holland is unique. The railroads of that
country were built partly by the state and partly by private enterprise,
but the working has always been wholly in private hands.
Some ten years ago, however, the Dutch government bought up
the private lines and rearranged the whole system. The main lines
of the country are now leased to two operating companies, so organized
that each company has access to every important town, and
railroad competition is now practically ubiquitous throughout Holland.
So far there are no signs that the Dutch people are otherwise
than satisfied with their system. Now compare this with
France. The French government, though it has hitherto, except
on the comparatively unimportant state railroads in the southwest
of the country, stood aloof from the actual operation, has
always kept entire control of railroad construction and of the allocation
of new lines between the several companies. And the
French government has proceeded on a principle diametrically opposed
to the Dutch principle. In France railroad competition has,
as far as possible, been definitely excluded, and the various systems
have been made to meet, not, as in Holland, at the great
towns, but at the points where the competitive traffic was, as near
as might be, a negligible quantity. Now that questions of competition
and combination are to the fore in England, and seem likely
to give very practical occupation to Parliament in the session of
1909, the precedents on both sides are perhaps not without interest.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AMERICA.</p>

<p>When we turn from the continent of Europe to the continent of
America the position of affairs is startlingly dissimilar. The railroads
of America far surpass in length those of the continent of
Europe, while in capital expenditure they are equal. State ownership
and operation of railroads on the continent of America is as
much the exception as it is the rule in Europe. In Canada there
is one comparatively important state railroad, the Intercolonial,
about 1,500 miles in length. Though its earnings are quite considerable&mdash;about
£20 per mile per week&mdash;it barely pays working
expenses. I may add that in all the voluminous literature of the subject
I have never seen this line cited as an example of the benefits
of state management. There is another small line, in Prince Edward
Island, which is worked at a loss; and a third, the Temiskam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>ing
&amp; Northern Ontario Railway, owned not by the Dominion but
by the Provincial government, which is too new to afford any
ground for conclusions.</p>

<p>The Federal government of the United States has never owned
a railroad, though some of the individual states did own, and in
some cases also work, railroads in very early days. They all burnt
their fingers badly. But the story is so old a one that it would
be unreasonable to found any argument on it today.</p>

<p>In Mexico, of which I shall have more to say directly, the state
owns no railroads. As for Central America, Costa Rica and Honduras
have some petty lines, which are worked at a loss. Guatemala
had a railroad till 1904, when it was transferred to a private company.
Nicaragua has also leased its lines. Colombia owns and
works at a profit, all of which is said to be devoted to betterment,
24 miles of line.</p>

<p>In South America, Peru and Argentina own, as far as I am
aware, no railroads. The Chilian government owns about 1,600
miles out of the 3,000 miles in the country. Needless to say private
capital has secured the most profitable lines. The government railroad
receipts hardly cover the working expenses. The Brazilian
government formerly owned a considerable proportion of its railroad
network of nearly 11,000 miles. Financial straits forced it
some years ago to dispose of a large part to private companies, to
the apparent advantage at once of the taxpayer, the shareholder
and the railroad customer. About 1,800 miles of line are still operated
by the government, the receipts of which, roughly speaking, do
a little more than balance working expenses. But it may be broadly
said that the present Brazilian policy is adverse to state ownership
and in favor of the development of the railroad system by private
enterprise.</p>


<p class="pfs80">THE UNITED STATES SITUATION.</p>

<p>The question of public ownership and operation was, however,
raised very definitely in the United States only two years ago, when
Mr. Bryan made a speech stating that his European experience had
convinced him that it was desirable to nationalize the railroads of
the United States. For many weeks after, Mr. Bryan's pronouncement
was discussed in every newspaper and on every platform, from
Maine to California. Practically, Mr. Bryan found no followers,
and today, though he is the accepted candidate of the Democratic
party for the Presidency, the subject has been tacitly shelved. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
some extent this may have been due to the ludicrous impossibility,
if I may say so with all respect for a possible President, of Mr.
Bryan's proposals. In order, presumably, not to offend his own
Democratic party, the traditional upholders of the rights of the several
states, he seriously suggested that the Federal government
should work the trunk lines, and the respective state governments
the branches. Even if anybody knew in every case what is a trunk
line and what is a branch, the result would be to create an organism
about as useful for practical purposes as would be a human body in
which the spinal cord was severed from the brain. Mr. Bryan's
proposal was never discussed in detail: public sentiment throughout
the Union was unexpectedly unanimous against it, and it is safe to
say that the nationalization of the railroads of the United States is
not in sight at present.</p>

<p>But though nationalization is nowhere in America a practical
issue, everywhere in America the relations between the railroads
and the state have become much closer within the last few years.
Canada a few years ago consolidated its railroad laws and established
a Railway Commission, to which was given very wide powers of
control both over railroad construction and operation and over rates
and fares for goods and passengers. Argentina has also moved in
the same direction. In the United States, not only has there been
the passage by the Federal Congress at Washington of the law
amending the original Act to Regulate Commerce and giving much
increased powers to the Interstate Commerce Commission, besides
various other Acts dealing with subsidiary points, such as hours of
railroad employes, but scores, if not hundreds, of Acts have been
passed by the various state legislatures. With these it is quite
impossible to deal in detail; many of them impose new pecuniary
burdens upon the railroad companies, as, for instance, the obligation
to carry passengers at the maximum rate of a penny per mile.
All of them, speaking broadly, impose new obligations and new
restrictions upon the railroad companies. Not a few have already
been declared unconstitutional, and therefore invalid, by the law
courts. And when the mills of American legal procedure shall at
length have finished their exceedingly slow grinding, it is safe to
prophesy that a good many more will have ceased to operate. But
for all that, the net result of state and Federal legislation in the sessions
of 1906 and 1907 will unquestionably be that even after the
reaction and repeal, which, thanks to the Wall street panic of last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
year, is now in progress, the railroads of the United States will in
the future be subject to much more rigid and detailed control by
public authority than there has been in the past. The reign of railroad
despotism, more or less benevolent, is definitely at an end; the
reign of law has begun. It is only to be regretted that the quantity
of the law errs as much on the side of excess as its quality on the
side of deficiency.</p>


<p class="pfs80">THE MEXICAN SITUATION.</p>

<p>Apart from its interest as a quite startling example of how not to
do it, the recent railroad legislation of the United States is only
valuable as an indication of the tendency, universal in all countries,
however governed, for the state to take a closer control over its
railroads. Much more interesting as containing a definite political
ideal, worked out in detail in a statesmanlike manner, is the recent
railroad legislation of Mexico. One may be thought to be verging
on paradox in suggesting that England, with seven centuries of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'parlimentary'">parliamentary</ins>
history, can learn something from the Republic of Mexico.
But for all that I would say, with all seriousness, that I believe the
relation between the state and the national railroads is one of the
most difficult and important questions of modern politics, and that
the one valuable and original contribution to the solution of that
question which has been made in the present generation is due to the
President of the Mexican Republic and his Finance Minister, Señor
Limantour.</p>

<p>Broadly, the Mexican situation is this: The Mexican railroads
were in the hands of foreign capitalists, English mainly so far as
the older lines were concerned, American in respect to the newer
railroads, more especially those which constituted continuations
southwards of the great American railroad systems. The foreign
companies, whether English or American, naturally regarded Mexico
as a field for earning dividends for their shareholders. The
American companies further, equally naturally, tended to regard
Mexico as an annexe and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dépendance</i> of the United States. If they
thought at all of the interest of Mexico in developing as an independent
self-contained state, they were bound to regard it with hostility
rather than with favor, and such a point of view could hardly
commend itself to the statesmen at the head of the Mexican government.
Yet Mexico is a poor and undeveloped country, quite unable
to dispense with foreign capital; and, further, it was at least questionable
whether Mexican political virtue was sufficiently firm-rooted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to withstand the manifold temptations inherent in the direct management
of railroads under a parliamentary <em>régime</em>. Under these circumstances
the Mexicans have adopted the following scheme: For
a comparatively small expenditure in actual cash, coupled with a
not very serious obligation to guarantee the interest on necessary
bond issues, the Mexican government have acquired such a holding
of deferred ordinary stock in the National Railroad Company of
Mexico as gives them, not, indeed, any immediate dividend on their
investment, but a present control in all essentials of the policy of
the company, and also prospects of considerable profit when the
country shall have further developed. The organization of the
company as a private commercial undertaking subsists as before. A
board of directors, elected in the ordinary manner by the votes of
shareholders, remains as a barrier against political or local pressure
in the direction of uncommercial concessions, whether of new lines
or of extended facilities or reduced rates on the old lines; but&mdash;and
here is the fundamental difference between the new system and the
old&mdash;whereas under the old system the final appeal was to a body of
shareholders with no interest beyond their own dividend, the majority
shareholder is now the Government of Mexico, with every
inducement to regard the interests, both present and prospective, of
the country as a whole.</p>


<p class="pfs80">IRREFRAGABLE THEORY OF PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.</p>

<p>Public ownership of railroads is in theory irrefragable. Railroads
are a public service; it is right that they should be operated
by public servants in the public interest. Unfortunately, especially
in democratically organized communities, the facts have not infrequently
refused to fit the theories, and the public servants have
allowed, or been constrained to allow, the railroads to be run, not
in the permanent interest of the community as a whole, but in the
temporary interest of that portion of the community which at the
moment could exert the most strenuous pressure. The Mexican
system, if it succeeds in establishing itself permanently&mdash;for as yet
it is only on its trial&mdash;may perhaps have avoided both Scylla and
Charybdis. Faced with a powerful but local and temporary demand,
the government may be able to reply that this is a matter to be dealt
with on commercial lines by the board of directors. If, on the other
hand, permanent national interests are involved, the government can
exercise its reserve power as a shareholder, can vote the directors
out of office, and so prevent the continuance of a policy which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in its judgment be prejudicial to those interests, however much it
might be to the advantage of the railroad as a mere commercial
concern.</p>


<p class="pfs80">STATE CONTROL OR OWNERSHIP.</p>

<p>The history whose outline I have now very briefly sketched shows,
I think, that whereas there is everywhere a tendency towards further
state control, the tendency towards absolute state-ownership
and state-operation is far from being equally universal. I shall have
a word to say presently as to the reasons why America shows no
signs of intention to follow the example of continental Europe.
Meanwhile it is well to notice that American experience proves also
the extreme difficulty of finding satisfactory methods of control.
Sir Henry Tyler said some five-and-thirty years ago in England, in
words that have often been quoted since, "If the state can't control
the railroads, the railroads will control the state"; and President
Roosevelt has again and again in the last few years insisted on the
same point. "The American people," he said in effect, "must work
out a satisfactory method of controlling these great organizations.
If left uncontrolled, there will be such abuses and such consequent
popular indignation that state-ownership will become inevitable, and
state-ownership is alien to American ideas, and might cause very
serious political dangers."</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my hearers may remember Macaulay's graphic
description of the passion that was aroused by Charles James Fox's
proposed India Bill; it was described as a Bill for giving in perpetuity
to the Whigs, whether in or out of office, the whole patronage
of the Indian government. The objection felt by American
statesmen to handing over their railroads to the National government&mdash;for
I think it may be taken for granted that if they were nationalized
it would have to be wholly under Federal management, and
that the separate states could take no part in the matter&mdash;is in principle
the same. There are something like a million and a half men
employed on the railroads of the United States, say roughly 7 or 8
per cent. of the voters. Americans feel that rival political parties
might bid against each other for the support of so vast and homogeneous
a body of voters; that the amount of patronage placed at
the disposal of the executive government for the time being would
be enormous; and that the general interests of the nation might be
sacrificed by politicians anxious to placate&mdash;to use their own term&mdash;particular
local and sectional interests. How far this fear, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
undoubtedly very prevalent in the states, is justified by the history
of state railroads in other countries is a question exceedingly difficult
to answer. Dealing with state railroads in the lump, it is easy to
point to some against which the charge would be conspicuously
untrue. To take the most important state railroad organization in
the world, the Prussian system, no one, I think, can fairly deny that
it has been operated&mdash;in intention at least, if not always in result&mdash;for
the greatest good of the greatest number. But then Prussia is
Prussia, with a government in effect autocratic, with a civil service
with strong <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> and permeated with old traditions, leading
them to regard themselves as the servants of the king rather
than as candidates for popular favor. An American statesman,
Charles Francis Adams, wrote as follows more than 30 years ago:
"In applying results drawn from the experience of one country to
problems which present themselves in another, the difference of
social and political habit and education should ever be borne in mind.
Because in the countries of continental Europe the state can and
does hold close relations, amounting even to ownership, with the
railroads, it does not follow that the same course could be successfully
pursued in England or in America. The former nations are
by political habit administrative, the latter are parliamentary. In
other words, France and Germany are essentially executive in their
governmental systems, while England and America are legislative.
Now the executive may design, construct or operate a railroad; the
legislative never can. A country therefore with a weak or unstable
executive, or a crude and imperfect civil service, should accept with
caution results achieved under a government of bureaus. Nevertheless,
though conclusions cannot be adopted in the gross, there may
be in them much good food for reflection."</p>


<p class="pfs80">CONTROL BY DEMOCRACY, OR OWNERSHIP BY AUTOCRACY.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the effect of the evidence is that the
further a government departs from autocracy and develops in the
direction of democracy, the less successful it is likely to be in the
direct management of railroads. Belgium is far from being a pure
democracy; but compared with Prussia it is democratic, and compared
with Prussia its railroad management is certainly inferior.
Popular opinion in Belgium seems at present to be exceedingly hostile
to the railroad administration; official documents assert that, while
the service to the public is bad, the staff are scandalously underpaid,
and yet that the railroads are actually not paying their way. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
was, it is true, till recently an accumulated surplus of profits carried
in the railroad accounts, but the official figures have been recently
revised, and the surplus is shown to be non-existent.</p>

<p>The Swiss experiment is too new to justify any very positive conclusions
being drawn from it; but this much is clear: the state has
had to pay for the acquisition of the private lines sums very much
larger than were put forward in the original estimate; the surplus
profits that were counted on have not been obtained in practice; the
economies that were expected to result from unification have not
been realized; the expenditure for salaries and wages has increased
very largely; and so far from there being a profit to the Federal
government, the official statement of the railroad administration is
that, unless the utmost care is exercised in the future, the railroad
receipts will not cover the railroad expenditure.</p>

<p>The Italian experiment is still newer. It would not be fair to say
that it proves anything against state management; but I do not think
that the most fervid <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Etatist</i> would claim that, either on the ground
of efficiency or on the ground of economy, it has so far furnished any
argument in favor of that policy.</p>

<p>If we wish to study the state management of railroads by pure
democracies of Anglo-Saxon type, we must go to our own Colonies.
My own impressions, formed after considerable study of the subject
and having had the advantage of talking with not a few of the men
who have made the history, I hesitate to give. It is easy to find
partisan statements on both sides; for example, in a recent article in
the <em>Nineteenth Century</em>, entitled "The Pure Politics Campaign in
Canada," I find the following quotation from the <cite>Montreal Gazette</cite>&mdash;a
paper of high standing&mdash;dated May 27, 1907: "Every job
alleged against the Russian autocracy has been paralleled in kind in
Canada. First, there is the awful example of the Intercolonial Railway,
probably as to construction the most costly single-track system
in North America, serving a good traffic-bearing country, with little
or no competition during much of the year, and in connection with
much of its length no competition at all, but so mishandled that one
of its managers, giving up his job in disgust, said it was run like a
comic opera. Some years it does not earn enough to pay the cost of
operation and maintenance (I may interpolate that its gross earnings
per mile are equal to those of an average United States railroad),
and every year it needs a grant of one, two, three or four million
dollars out of the Treasury to keep it in condition to do at a loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the business that comes to it. When land is to be bought for the
road, somebody who knows what is intended obtains possession of it,
and turns it over to the government at 40, 50 and 100 per cent
advance. This is established by the records of Parliament and of the
courts of the land."</p>


<p class="pfs80">AFRICAN CAPE GOVERNMENT RAILROADS.</p>

<p>Probably no one outside the somewhat heated air of Canadian
politics is likely to believe this damning accusation quite implicitly;
but even if there were not a word of truth in it&mdash;and that the management
of the Intercolonial Railway is, for whatever cause, bad,
appears, I think, clearly from the public figures&mdash;it is bad enough
that such charges should be publicly made and apparently believed.
Let me quote now from a document of a very different type referring
to a colony very far distant from Canada: "A memorandum relative
to Railroad Organization, prepared at the request of the Railroad
Commissioners of the Cape Government Railways, by Sir
Thomas R. Price, formerly general manager of those railroads, and
now general manager of the Central South Africa (<em>i. e.</em>, Transvaal
and Orange River) Railways, dated Johannesburg, February 22,
1907."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The drawbacks in the management of the railroads in the Cape that call
for removal arise from the extent to which, and the manner in which, the
authority of Parliament is exercised. They are twofold in their character,
viz.:</p>

<p>"(1) The practice of public authorities, influential persons, and others
bent on securing concessions or other advantages which the general manager
has either refused in the conscientious exercise of his functions, or is not
likely to grant, making representation to the Commissioner (as the ministerial
head of the Government), supplemented by such pressure, political
influence, or other means as are considered perfectly legitimate in their way,
and are best calculated to attain the end applicants have in view.</p>

<p>"(Many members of Parliament act similarly in the interests of the districts,
constituents, or railroad employes in whom they happen to be interested.
It is by no means unknown for the requests in both classes of cases to
coincide somewhat with a critical division in Parliament&mdash;present or in prospect&mdash;or
otherwise something has occurred which is regarded as irritating to
the public or embarrassing to the Government, and the desire to minimize the
effect by some conciliatory act is not unnatural.)</p>

<p>"(2) The extent to which the fictitious, and often transitory, importance
which a community or district manages to acquire obscures (under the
guise of the Colony's welfare) the consideration of the railroad and general
interest in the Colony as a whole."</p>

<p>(During the earlier period of my railroad service in the Cape Colony few
things impressed me more, coming as I had from a railroad conducted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
strictly business lines, than the extent to which the conduct of railroad
affairs was influenced by certain conditions. Nor was this impression lessened
afterwards when, in the course of a conversation on the matter, Sir
Charles Elliott mentioned to me that he had more than once told a late
railway commissioner, "The Government is powerful, but [mentioning the
town and authority] is more powerful still.")</p>

<p>"I do not regard it as open to doubt that the Colony as a whole has
suffered severely in consequence, the inland portions of the Colony particularly
so; and that the need for a remedy is pressing if the railroads
are to be conducted as a business concern for the benefit of the Colony.</p>

<p>"The necessity for the railroads and their administration being removed
from such an atmosphere, and treated as a most valuable means of benefiting
the Colony as a whole, while not neglecting the interests of a district
(but not subordinating the welfare of the whole Colony thereto), is pressing.
That there should be an authority to refer to in case of real necessity,
where the decision or action of the general manager is not regarded as
being in the public interests, is also clear. But it is equally manifest that
the Commissioner or the Government of the day, with political or party
consideration always in view, is not the proper court of reference.</p>

<p>"There can be little doubt that in the Cape Colony political considerations
have influenced the adoption of new lines and their construction&mdash;many, if
not most of them of an unprofitable character&mdash;without sufficient inquiry
or information, often with scanty particulars, and possibly contrary to the
advice of the officer afterwards entrusted with the construction and working
of the line.</p>

<p>"A material change is imperatively necessary in this respect, if only to
insure the solvency of the Colony."</p></div>


<p class="pfs80">VICTORIAN (AUSTRALIA) RAILROADS.</p>

<p>It is sometimes conceded that improper exercise of political influence
may be a real danger where railroads are managed under a
parliamentary <em>régime</em> by a Minister directly responsible to Parliament;
but that difficulty, it is said, can be got over by the appointment
of an independent Commission entirely outside the political
arena. History does not altogether justify the contention. The last
report of the Victorian State Railways gives a list of seven branches,
with an aggregate length of 46 miles, constructed under the Commissioner
<em>régime</em> at a cost of £387,000, which are now closed for
traffic and abandoned because the gross receipts failed even to cover
the out-of-pocket working expenses. It is not alleged, nor is it a
fact, that those lines were constructed in consequence of any error
of judgment on the part of the Commissioners. But in truth it is
inherently impossible to use a Commission to protect a community
against itself. In theory a Commission might be a despot perfectly
benevolent and perfectly intelligent; in that case, however, it can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
hardly be said that the nation manages its own railroads. But of
course any such idea is practically impossible, because despots, however
benevolent and intelligent, cannot be made to fit into the framework
of an Anglo-Saxon constitution. In practical life the Railway
Commission must be responsible to someone, and that someone can
only be a member of the political government of the day.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COMPETITION HAS CEASED TO REGULATE.</p>

<p>I have indicated what in America, where the subject is much more
carefully considered than here, is regarded as a great obstacle to a
state-railroad system; but I have pointed out also that it is quite
possible that statesmen fully alive to the dangers may yet find themselves
constrained to risk them unless some satisfactory method of
controlling private railroad enterprise can be found. I do not think
it can be considered that this has been done in England at the present
time. In the main we have relied on the force of competition to
secure for us reasonable service at not unreasonable rates; and as I
still cherish a long-formed belief that English railroads are on the
whole among the best, if not actually the best, in the world, I am
far from saying that competition has not done its work well. But
competition is an instrument that is at this moment breaking in our
hands. Within quite a few years the South Eastern Railway was
united with the Chatham; the Great Southern has obtained a monopoly
over a large part of Ireland; in Scotland the Caledonian and the
North British, the Highland and the Great North have in very great
measure ceased to compete. If the present proposals for the working
union of the Great Eastern, the Great Northern and the Great
Central go through, competition in the East of England will be
absolutely non-existent from the Channel to the Tweed. And one
can hardly suppose that matters will stop there. In fact, since this
address was in type a comprehensive scheme of arrangement for a
long term of years between the London &amp; North Western and the
Midland has been announced. We must, I think, assume that competition,
which has done good work for the public in its day, is practically
ceasing to have any real operation in regulating English
railroads.</p>


<p class="pfs80">HOW SHALL GOVERNMENT REGULATE?</p>

<p>For regulation, therefore, we must fall back on government; but
how shall a government exercise its functions? Regulation may be
legislative, judicial, executive, or, as usually happens in practice, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
combination of all three. But we may notice that, as Mr. Adams
points out, in Anglo-Saxon countries it is the Legislature and the
Judicature that are predominant; whereas in a country like France,
which though a democracy is bureaucratically organized, it is executive
regulation that is most important. Now, the capacity of the
Legislature to regulate is strictly limited; it can lay down general
rules; it can, so to speak, provide a framework, but it cannot decide
<em>ad hoc</em> how to fit into that framework the innumerable questions
that come up for practical decision day by day.</p>

<p>The capacity of the law courts to regulate is even more strictly
limited. For not only is it confined within the precise limits of the
jurisdiction expressly conferred upon it by the Legislature, but further,
by the necessity of the case, a court of law can only decide the
particular case brought before it; a hundred other cases, equally
important in principle, and perhaps more important in practice, may
never be brought before it at all. Even if the court had decided all
the principles, it has no machinery to secure their application to any
other case than the one particular case on which judgment was given.
There was a case decided 30 years ago by our Railroad Commission,
the principle of which, had it been generally applied throughout the
country, would have revolutionized the whole carrying business of
Great Britain. It has not been so applied, to the great advantage, in
my judgment, of English trade. Further, the great bulk of the cases
which make up the practical work of a railroad: "What is a reasonable
rate, having regard to all the circumstances, present and prospective,
of the case? Would it be reasonable to run a new train or to
take off an old one? Would it be reasonable to open a new station,
to extend the area of free cartage, and the like?"&mdash;all these are questions
of discretion, of commercial instinct. They can only be answered
with a "Probably on the whole," not with a categorical "Yes"
or "No," and they are absolutely unsuitable for determination by the
positive methods of the law court with its precisely defined issues, its
sworn evidence, and its rigorous exclusion of what, while the lawyer
describes it as irrelevant, is often precisely the class of consideration
which would determine one way or other the decision of the practical
man of business.</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that both in England and in America
we must expect to see in the near future a considerable development
of executive government control over railroads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss in detail the form that control
should take, but one or two general observations seem worth making.
The leading example of executive control is France; in that country
the system is worked out with all the French neatness and all the
French logic. But it is impossible to imagine the French principle
being transplanted here. For one thing, the whole French railroad
finance rests upon the guarantee of the government. The French
government pays, or at least is liable to pay, the piper, and has,
therefore, the right to call the tune. The English government has
not paid and does not propose to pay, and its claim to call the tune
is therefore much less. Morally the French government has a right&mdash;so
far at least as the railroad shareholders are concerned&mdash;to call
on a French company to carry workmen at a loss; morally, in my
judgment at least, the English government has no such right. But
there is a further objection to the French system; the officers of the
French companies have on their own responsibility to form their
own decisions, and then the officers of the French government have,
also on their own responsibility, to decide whether the decision of
the company's officer shall be allowed to take effect or not. The company's
officer has the most knowledge and the most interest in deciding
rightly, but the government official has the supreme power.
The system has worked&mdash;largely, I think, because the principal officers
of the companies have been trained as government servants in
one or other of the great Engineering Corps, des Mines or des Ponts
et Chaussées. But it is vicious in principle, and in any case would
not bear transplanting.</p>

<p>What we need is a system under which the responsibility rests, as
at present, with a single man (let us call him the general manager),
and he does what he on the whole decides to be best, subject however
to this: that if he does what no reasonable man could do, or
refuses to do what any reasonable man would do, there shall be a
power behind to restrain, or, as the case may be, to compel him. And
that power may, I think, safely be simply the Minister&mdash;let us call
him the President of the Board of Trade. For, be it observed, the
question for him is not the exceedingly difficult and complicated
question, "What is best to be done?" but the quite simple question,
"Is the decision come to which I am asked to reverse so obviously
wrong that no reasonable man could honestly make it?"</p>

<p>And even this comparatively simple question the President would
not be expected to decide unaided. He will need competent advisory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
bodies. Railroad history shows two such bodies that have been eminently
successful&mdash;the Prussian State Railway Councils and the
Massachusetts Railroad Commission. Wholly unlike in most respects,
they are yet alike in this: their proceedings are public, their
conclusions are published, and those conclusions have no mandatory
force whatever. And it is to these causes that, in my judgment, their
success, which is undeniable, is mainly due. Let me describe both
bodies a little more at length.</p>

<p>There are in Prussia a number (about ten I think) of District Railway
Councils, and there is also one National Council; they consist
of a certain number of representative traders, manufacturers, agriculturists,
and the like, together with a certain number of government
nominees; and the railroad officials concerned take part in their
proceedings, but without votes. The Councils meet three or four
times a year, their agenda paper is prepared and circulated in advance,
and all proposed changes of general interest, whether in rates
or in service, are brought before them, from the railroad side or the
public side, as the case may be. The decision of the Council is then
available for information of the Minister and his subordinates, but
as has been said, it binds nobody.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Railroad Commission is a body of three persons,
usually one lawyer, one engineer and one man of business, appointed
for a term of years by the Governor of the state. Originally
the powers of this Commission were confined to the expression of
opinion. If a trade, or a locality, or indeed a single individual,
thought he was being treated badly by a Massachusetts railroad, he
could complain to the Commission; his complaint was heard in public;
the answer of the railroad company was made there and then;
and thereupon the Commissioners expressed their reasoned opinion.
The system has existed now for more than 30 years, and it is safe
to say that, with negligible exceptions, if the Commission expresses
the opinion that the railroad is in the right, the applicant accepts it;
if the Commission says that the applicant has a real grievance, the
railroad promptly redresses it on the lines which the Commission's
opinion has indicated. The success of the Commission in gaining
the confidence of both sides has been so great that of late years its
powers have been extended, and it has been given, for example, authority
to control the issue of new capital and the construction of
new lines. But on the question with which we are specially concerned
here, the conduct of existing railroad companies as public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
servants, it can still do nothing but express an opinion; and it may
be added that the Commission itself has more than once objected
to any extension of that power.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams, from whom I have already quoted, was the first Chairman
of the Commission. He has described their position as resting
"on the one great social feature which distinguishes modern civilization
from any other of which we have a record, the eventual supremacy
of an enlightened public opinion." That public opinion is
supreme in this country, few would be found to deny; that public
opinion in railroad matters is enlightened, few would care to assert.
But given the enlightened public opinion, one can hardly doubt that
it will secure not merely eventual but immediate supremacy. In
truth, as Bagehot once pointed out, a great company is of necessity
timorous in confronting public opinion. It is so large that it must
have many enemies, and its business is so extended that it offers
innumerable marks to shoot at. It is much more likely to make, for
the sake of peace, concessions that ought not to be made than it is
to resist a demand that reasonable men with no personal interest in
the matter publicly declare to be such as ought rightly to be conceded.</p>

<p>To sum up in a sentence the lesson which I think the history we
have been considering conveys, it is this: Closer connection than
has hitherto existed between the state and its railroads has got to
come, both in this country and in the United States. Hitherto in
Anglo-Saxon democracies neither state ownership nor state control
has been over-successful. The best success has been obtained by
relying for control, not on the constable, but on the eventual supremacy
of an enlightened public opinion. Nearly 20 years ago, in the
pages of the <cite>Economic Journal</cite>, I appealed to English economists
to give us a serious study of what the Americans call the transportation
problem in its broad economic and political aspects. Since then
half-a-dozen partisan works have appeared on the subject, not one
of them in my judgment worth the paper on which it is printed;
but not a single serious work by a trained economist. And yet
such a work is today needed more than ever. Let me once more
appeal to some of our younger men to come forward, stop the gap,
and enlighten public opinion.</p>

<h2><a name="RAILWAY_NATIONALIZATION" id="RAILWAY_NATIONALIZATION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">RAILWAY NATIONALIZATION</a></h2>

<p class="center smcap">By Sir George S. Gibb.</p>

<p class="center">A paper read at a meeting of the Royal Economic Society, on 10th
November, 1908.</p>


<p>Railway nationalization has for many years occupied the minds
of economic and political students and the practical activities of
statesmen in many countries and in English colonies. It has been
regarded here as a remote possibility which might some day or other
come to the front for practical discussion. But quite recently it
would have been thought to be as incredible that any responsible
politicians should be considering proposals for purchasing our railways
for the State as that any substantial number of persons could
be found who would advocate an abandonment of the fundamental
principle that there should be no taxation of imports into England
except for revenue purposes. In these days, however, public opinion
moves suddenly and rapidly. The despised fallacy of yesterday
rises as the creed of to-day. There are already many indications
that, before long, there will be a numerous and influential, though
perhaps a somewhat heterogeneous party, who will urge that immediate
steps should be taken to nationalize our railways.</p>

<p>The test, and the only test, to be applied to proposals for railway
nationalization is whether railways owned by the State and worked
directly by Government officials would be better and more efficient
than railways owned and worked by private corporations, and
whether, after taking account of all the effects of the change, upon
each class, each district, each interest, the net result would increase
the wealth and well-being of the community, and be a permanent
benefit to the public.</p>

<p>We may, I think, start from the assumption that railway proprietors
as such have no interest in opposing nationalization. The value
of their property, whether measured in terms of capital value or
in terms of future income, estimated on a fair basis, would, it is
assumed, be fully provided for in the gigantic financial operation
which railway purchase would involve. There is no legal flaw in
the title of railway proprietors. They enjoy the fundamental rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
attached by our law to absolute property, subject only to the performance
of obligations definitely prescribed by Acts of Parliament.
I think, therefore, that we may discuss this subject of railway
nationalization without apprehension that the change, if it were
adopted by the deliberate judgment of the community, would be
accompanied by anything in the nature of confiscation of existing
rights.</p>

<p>This might not be the intention or the wish of all who think that
our railways should be nationalized. Probably some extreme Socialists
would like to transfer railways to the State without giving
what, in our judgment, would be adequate compensation to existing
owners. Their aim is the substitution of a new social polity for
that which exists, in which antiquated ideas of private property
would have no place. But that is only a phase of their creed which
condemns it to sterility. It is not the small band of Socialist zealots,
but the majority of the nation that we have to consider in estimating
the risk of anything being done in the nature of confiscation.</p>

<p>Those who join the party for nationalizing will, no doubt, find
themselves in strange company. There can be little doubt that the
movement up to the present has been mainly Socialistic. A trader,
who advocates nationalization because he hopes that he might be
able to transfer to somebody else, perhaps he does not very much
care whom, some part of the burden of the charges which he has
to pay for railway carriage, will find that his next neighbor at a
meeting of the party is a man who has joined for quite other reasons,
with the object, indeed, of ultimately seizing for the State some
part of his neighbor, the trader's, property, which the latter was
reckoning to increase at the expense of, amongst others, his neighbor
the Socialist, through the plan of railway nationalization. But the
homogeneity of the party need not concern us, nor the question
whether each and every member of it would be actuated by a single-minded
desire for the public good. The forces making for honesty
and equity in the treatment of existing interests would, I think, so
overwhelmingly outweigh the influences tending in a contrary direction
that we need not complicate the question by importing into it
a discussion as to whether adequate compensation should or would
be paid to existing owners in the event of the State deciding to
acquire their property. Fair and adequate compensation for existing
interests may be taken for granted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>But although compensation can be paid for property, it cannot
be paid to the general community who would suffer in the event
of the administration and operation of railways under State management
being less efficient than under private management. If a
mistake be made, all would suffer, and their sufferings would not,
and could not, be mitigated by compensation in any form.</p>

<p>It may be useful at the outset to consider what has led to the
question of railway nationalization in this country being discussed.</p>

<p>The origin and the causes of those movements in public opinion
which bring about great constitutional and social changes are frequently
most difficult to trace, especially by contemporary observers.
For a full understanding of such movements, it is necessary to
wait for the historian's point of view, and to survey a wider field
than is possible whilst the events are occurring, when much of the
material for final judgment as to the causes in operation is concealed
in an undisclosed future.</p>

<p>That there is a movement in progress tending to the nationalization
of railways in England is apparent to every thoughtful observer
of the times. But whence does this movement come, and what are
its principal causes? We are able to identify some of them, less
able to weigh the relative importance of each, still less able to
foretell the ultimate share which each will have on the future
course of development, which will depend on the direction taken
by other movements in public opinion which, at the moment, may
seem to be entirely independent of all connection with the particular
movement we are considering.</p>

<p>I will refer to a few of the causes which seem to me to be most
prominently at work, but I will not attempt to state them in the
order of their importance. I will merely enumerate those which
are plainly discernible as existing in some shape or other.</p>

<p>The first I will name, though it may not be the most influential,
is the existence of a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the
present state of railway administration. I suppose that if railway
services were as good as possible, charges as cheap as possible,
profits as high as possible, and the management as perfect as it
is possible for railway management to be, and these conditions
were generally admitted to exist, the natural instinct to leave well
alone would prevent any proposal for nationalization from obtaining
a hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be conceded that there is a certain feeling of dissatisfaction,
superficial and indefinite though it be, to which advocates
of nationalization, whose schemes originate in considerations which
have no relation either to the excellence or to the imperfections
of railway arrangements, are able to appeal in the pursuit of their
aims. It is not that many people really think that our railways
do not, as a whole, serve the public well, whatever individuals may
say in moments of haste. Hut complaints are sufficiently numerous
to have a real importance as an influence on public opinion. And,
unfortunately, their influence is to a large extent independent of
their justice. The existence of criticism, which, after all, is only
another name for difference of opinion, is inevitable, and probably
would be inevitable under the most perfect system of railway management
which the world has seen or ever can see. State railways
would not be immaculate. The nature of railway business lays
it open, to an exceptional extent, to the unpopularity which unavoidably
gathers round every institution on which there is universal
dependence. Providence itself does not wholly escape
unpopularity. No other industry is comparable with the railway
industry in the close dependence upon it of the vast majority of
the people. The necessity for transport services penetrates more
frequently and more deeply into the lives and habits of the people
than any of the other prime necessities of civilization. The need
for transport is a tyranny. All tyrants are unpopular. And the
tyranny of a need is apt to beget, by an illogical transposition of
ideas, a dislike of those who are responsible for supplying the
need. People are conscious of grievances, or, let us say, unsupplied
wants. They cannot measure the range of possibility which limits
the supply of those wants or remedies for those grievances. They
constantly wish for the impossible, but have not sufficient knowledge
to distinguish between the possible and the impossible. Defects
which cannot be remedied are generally condemned with more
emphasis than those which are due to mismanagement. It is irrelevant
to consider whether the dissatisfaction to which I have referred
is justified or not. Whether well or ill founded, it must be set
down as one of the causes of the movement for nationalization.</p>

<p>The second cause I would mention is a belief, growing from a
suspicion into a conviction under the stimulus of repeated failures
in control experiments, that it is impossible for any Government,
by any legislative or executive action in any form, to exercise useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and effective control over railways. People turn in despair from
ideas of regulation and control to ideas of ownership.</p>

<p>The third cause is the prevalence of that feeling which, for want
of a better name, I will call district jealousy. The competition of
privately-owned railways undoubtedly does create inequalities. It
would be mere affectation to pretend that the railway accommodation
and facilities afforded to all places and all districts are equal
in merit and value. The less favored districts see other districts
enjoying superior facilities. They do not allow for differences in
conditions which, in some cases, explain and justify the differences
of service. I say in some cases, because it would be impossible to
deny that in other cases the comparative inferiority of railway
facilities cannot be explained away by inevitable determining conditions.
Hence district jealousy arises and a desire for uniformity,
such uniformity as it is hoped a State system of railways would
give.</p>

<p>The fourth cause I would name is the example of other countries.
This is affecting men's judgments with great force. We are slow to
be moved by foreign example. But there is an increasing tendency
to submit to international influences, and foreign example in this
matter does, on the whole, point to national railways becoming the
generally accepted system.</p>

<p>The fifth cause is the one which, I think, has more to do with
the initiation of the discussion of nationalization schemes than any
other cause. This is the general tendency of the time to Socialistic
experiments. If there were no Socialists, and no Socialism in the
thought of the age, there would, we may safely conclude, be no talk
of nationalization of railways. It is the Socialistic propaganda, and
the influence which that propaganda has had on many minds, which
more than anything else has brought the question of the nationalization
of railways within the range of practical discussion.</p>

<p>The sixth cause is the anxious search for more revenue for the
State. National expenditure has grown to such enormous and
alarming dimensions that the provision of revenue to meet it has
become a serious and urgent difficulty. A Chancellor of the Exchequer
on the lookout for cash has not been able to resist the
attraction of railways as a source of revenue for the State. He
has noted the various influences at work which are tending to
bring the question of railway nationalization to the front, has looked
with envy at the large revenue which Prussian railways yield to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the State, and has at least gone the length of asking himself the
question, within the hearing of reporters, whether he ought not to
encourage and to take advantage of a state of opinion which might
conceivably be worked upon so as to create a majority prepared
to approve the principle of State ownership of what might be a
highly lucrative State monopoly.</p>

<p>The mileage of railways open for traffic in the United Kingdom
at the end of each of the last four decades up to 1907 is shown in
the following table:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The growth has been slow and decreases with each decade. It
is probably true that the period of construction has nearly come
to an end. Future additions to the mileage are not likely to be
either large or of substantial importance. This rather indicates
the present as a suitable time for considering a change of system.
The considerations which are applicable to what I may call the
age of construction are very different from those which become
most important in the age of operation.</p>

<p>It would probably be accepted as indisputable that in a country
like England, where capital is plentiful and enterprise active, the
system of leaving the construction of railways to private enterprise
is the best system.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought as to the respective merits of private
and public ownership, it cannot be denied that private enterprise
does take more risk than any Government is likely to do, except
under pressure of military necessities. The hope of gain is the
strongest motive for enterprise, and this desire operates more
strongly on the private citizen than it does on the State.</p>

<p>The growth of railway mileage during the age of construction
in any country is promoted by the constant influence and moving
force of those incentives which act on capitalists. The spur of
competition is always in active operation. Then there are the very
powerful professional influences which are constantly at work to
induce capitalists to spend their money on works and enterprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
which afford professional work, even if they do not subsequently
provide dividends.</p>

<p>Theoretically; no doubt, railways promoted by private enterprise
tend to the favoring of particular localities at the expense of other
localities. Perhaps it is right that the stronger should grow at the
expense of the weaker, but, at all events, it is inevitable. You
cannot expect private competitors to think of anything but their
own interests. And if this be so, you cannot expect from a system
in which private interests predominate the same consideration of
general design, from the point of view of the interests of the whole
country, as from a system which places public in front of private
interests.</p>

<p>It is difficult to deny that the miscellaneous and unequal activities
of private enterprise fail in the absence of some central guidance
to produce the best results so far as harmony and completeness
of design are concerned. In England railway construction has
not been, as in America, almost entirely free from any public control.
We have had the control, I think the most salutary and useful
control of Parliament, so far as it has gone, both over location and
capitalization. But it has not gone far. Although there has been
a certain amount of control, there has been practically no guidance.
The control, under the system of private bill legislation, has been
very ineffectual except as regards capitalization. It has been mainly
negative; never constructive. All that Parliament could practically
do was to prohibit the making of particular railways which aroused
opposition from some landowning or railway interests powerful
enough to oppose and wealthy enough to pay the heavy costs of
opposition. Private interests have been protected, but the general
interest has, in the main, been ignored.</p>

<p>But whilst conceding that it would have been a great advantage
if the vagaries of private enterprise had been more restrained by
some prudent, general guidance, I think that the chief public requirement
during the age of construction is that as much mileage
as possible should be constructed; and I submit, as a true conclusion
on the point I am discussing, that, as regards the age of construction,
at all events, England has derived incalculable benefit from
the fact that the railway system has been made by private enterprise.
But the problem of working the railway system after it
has been constructed is, I admit, essentially different from the
problem of securing its construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>My subject is not one which admits of discussion except on
very general lines. Our views on it must necessarily be formed
under the influence of the opinions we hold as to the legitimate
functions of the State. It has been truly said that no country has
ever adopted State ownership of railways from theoretical considerations.
In each and every instance there were some practical
reasons, based on military necessities or concrete and pressing
economic conditions to meet which State ownership was accepted,
not as a system desirable in itself, but as an expedient which, in
the circumstances, was considered to be the best practical solution
of difficulties which stood in the way of the satisfactory development
of railways. But whilst agreeing with this as a true historical
statement, I doubt whether theory can be entirely excluded from a
statement of the genesis of national railway systems. In a country
where Individualist opinions prevail, as I think at the present time
they do in England, no temptations, no pressure of circumstances
short of extreme national emergency, would induce people to face
the evils which the Individualist knows must result from the intrusion
of State action into matters of trade. This is theory,
although those who are influenced by it may think that it is founded
on practical experience. On the other hand, those persons who
wish to secure trading profits for the State even at the cost of
taking commercial risks, or who, when difficulties and obstacles
arise in commercial development, resort to the powers of the State
to overcome them, either by the imposition of taxes on the general
community in the interests of a class, or by handing over to State
officials the direction of an industry, instead of relying on the skill,
self-reliance, enterprise, energy, and character of the people, are
Socialists at heart, whether they know it or not, and are actuated
by the radical theory of a creed which, perhaps, most of them
would disavow.</p>

<p>But, after all, the question is not whether State purchase would
be a step in the Socialist direction, but whether it would be a step
in the right direction. Why should we change? Are we suffering
from intolerable evils from which there is no other way of escape,
or is there some great national benefit to be derived from the
change?</p>

<p>The general case for nationalization, as put forward by its advocates,
rests on very few arguments, and it is not, I think, unfair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to describe these as being mainly assumptions, the accuracy of which
it is impossible to verify. I may summarize a few of these:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Government management would be more efficient and less
costly than private management.</p>

<p>(2) Government management would primarily regard the interests
of the community and of the country as a whole, and the substitution
of that condition for the existing system under which the
interests of private trading concerns take first place in the thoughts
and efforts of those responsible for management would have the
effect of securing a more equal and more satisfactory development
of the resources of the country, and, as one writer expresses it
with more than the usual proportion of assumption in his statement,
trade would be stimulated under equitable, reasonable, and
uniform systems of rates.</p>

<p>(3) The change would result in the removal of most of the serious
complaints made against the existing administration of railways.</p>

<p>(4) Those who refuse to look upon the matter as mainly a commercial
problem think and hope that new means would be found
for the satisfaction of the social needs of the nation if the railways
were at the disposal of the Government.</p>

<p>(5) Experience of the economy resulting from large combinations
in other industries is invoked in support of the proposal to
get rid of the separate administrations of private railways. It is
said that the advantage of production on the largest scale by a
single corporation in place of production by a number of smaller
units is being verified by the experience of nearly every important
trade and industry. The principle has been recognized in the history
of railway development in this country by the amalgamation of
large numbers of small railways into the great railway systems
which we now see, and it is argued that a further step should now
be taken in the same direction. But a step involving the creation
of so great a monopoly as further large amalgamations would
involve can only, it is thought, be taken by the State. In this country
the largest railway system under one management is no greater
than about 2,000 miles in length, whereas in the United States of
America railway systems covering about 15,000 miles are now
under the control of a single President and a Board of Directors.
It is said, therefore, that modern methods of administration have
made it feasible to direct the 23,000 miles of railway in the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Kingdom efficiently and successfully by means of one comprehensive
organization, and probably if there is to be one organization
there would be no difference of opinion that the single organization
to own, control, and manage the railways must be the State.</p>

<p>Most of the principal objections are, I think, covered by the following
list:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) State management would be less efficient than management
under private enterprise.</p>

<p>(2) The extension of Government patronage, by placing at the
disposal of Government such a vast number of appointments to
lucrative offices.</p>

<p>(3) The risk of political corruption, not only in connection with
the exercise of patronage, but also in ordinary administration in
the settlement of questions relating to charges, wages, and services.</p>

<p>(4) The danger that interested parties would, by political pressure,
compel the State to expend public money on unremunerative
lines and unremunerative services.</p>

<p>(5) The contraction of the available field for private enterprise,
and hence the weakening of the foundation of all individual and
national progress.</p>

<p>(6) The introduction of serious dangers in connection with labor
disputes between the Government and the large body of railway
servants.</p>

<p>The subject has not been sufficiently long under public discussion
to make it easy to state fully the hopes of its supporters and the
fears of its opponents. Probably both are exaggerated. If one
examines the complaints made against the existing railway system, it
is obvious that many of these must exist under any system, whilst
some are the necessary accompaniments of every system into which
competition enters. But if competition is discarded in favor of
monopoly it does not need argument to show that this merely
means a change from the evils of competition to the evils of monopoly.
No one would deny that each system contains inherent and
characteristic evils. The evil of competition is waste; the evils of
monopoly are stagnation and the restriction of freedom.</p>

<p>Hitherto, for the regulation of railways, reliance has been placed
on two factors&mdash;competition and control. Parliamentary action and
public opinion have veered about from one to the other, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
absence of clear principle in the policy of the Legislature has introduced
evils which a more logical and consistent adherence either
to the policy of free competition on the one hand, or to the policy
of strict control on the other, would have avoided. That some
regulation is necessary all would admit. Railways sell transportation
as a commodity, but the nature of the business makes it impossible
to secure the conditions of absolutely free competition as in
the case of other industries. Hence the necessity for control, but
every plan of control that has been tried has proved practically
inoperative and ineffective mainly because it has endeavored to
leave competition in operation, and it is the evils which necessarily
arise from competition which lead to most of the complaints against
railways. The inevitable weakness of the dual system of competition
and control is that control checks competition just where it
would be useful in the public interest, and competition nullifies
control just where it could be advantageously applied.</p>

<p>Under no system could we expect railways to be free from complaints.
They arise equally from the nature of the business and
the nature of the customers. But with a view to seeing whether
State ownership would remedy the complaints that exist, let us try
to understand as clearly as possible what the complaints are. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Lloyd-George), speaking to a
deputation of traders in 1906, when he was President of the Board
of Trade, said that he was impressed with the "great and growing
discontent with the whole system."</p>

<p>Now what are the causes of the present discontent? Is it great?
Is it growing? These are questions very difficult to answer. But
there are some useful data available for the answer. The way
has been made plain and easy for complainants against railways.
Every encouragement and every facility has been afforded to them.
A special Court has been created&mdash;the Railway and Canal Commission&mdash;the
constitution of which was carefully framed so as to
encourage anyone with a grievance against railways to hope that
he would get a sympathetic hearing of his case. The applications
to that Court were so few that those people who cannot bring themselves
to believe that the number of real, as distinct from imaginary,
grievances against railways are remarkably few, said that the public
were deterred from bringing complaints forward by the expense
of litigation before the Railway Commissioners. So, to render the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
path of the complainant still easier, a procedure was introduced
which is unique for simplicity and cheapness. All, without distinction,
who had any complaint or grievance of any sort or kind against
any railway or canal company, were invited to come and lay the
same before a Department of Government, the Board of Trade,
who practically promised to use their influence to secure an amicable
adjustment of any differences. This procedure is so simple, so
sweeping, so all-embracing, so encouraging to complainants, and
has, on the whole, been exercised by the Board of Trade with so
much tact and success, that its records should supply the information
we are seeking.</p>

<p>In view of these efforts to get every aggrieved or discontented
person to come forward and disclose his complaint, is it possible
to imagine that there are now any concealed complaints? It is
often said that traders will not complain, that they are afraid of
rousing the hostility of those terrible tyrants, the railways, whose
power in England, at any rate, whatever it may be in America, is
ludicrously exaggerated. It is true that a sensible trader who has a
fair case does not fly with it to the Board of Trade. He submits
it to the railway officers in the ordinary daily course of business, and
almost invariably gets the matter adjusted. But I do not believe
that there is any trader who would be deterred from submitting a
complaint to the Board of Trade by any feeling of fear. On the
contrary, traders in these days suffer from an excess of boldness.
If a trader is dissatisfied with any railway charge, he simply refuses
to pay, and only those who have experience of the daily conduct
of railway business can know how common, and unfortunately how
effective, this remedy is.</p>

<p>The Board of Trade make an annual report to Parliament of all
complaints made to them under their conciliation jurisdiction, and
I think the contents of these reports may fairly be relied on as
presenting a complete view of the kind of complaints that exist
against railways. A useful table is given in the tenth report of the
Board of Trade, issued in July last, showing the total number of
complaints for ten years, classified according to their nature as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Of the total number forty-eight were complaints against canal companies,
but these are not separated in the classification.</p>

<p>Surely the above is a remarkable table, considering the vast aggregate
of business and the facilities offered for complaints. Only
1,529 complaints against railways, or an average of about 153 per
annum, have been found to exist.</p>

<p>Then look at the results of these complaints. These are given in
another table, and only 573 complaints, or an average of 57 per
annum, are entered as resulting in the complainants finally expressing
themselves as dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Services for which the aggregate payment amounts to 120 millions
sterling per annum are rendered, and yet there are only an
average of fifty-seven cases per annum of dissatisfied complainants
to the most open, most favorable, and least costly tribunal in the
world for hearing complaints against railways.</p>

<p>Now let us look at the nature of the complaints made. Would
State ownership remedy any of these complaints? I set aside the
510 cases of miscellaneous complaints about delay in transit and
other minor matters, because it is obvious that complaints about
such matters would not disappear under any conceivable system of
railway management.</p>

<p>Practically all other complaints group themselves under two
heads:</p>

<p class="noindent pad8">
1. Excessive rates.<br />

2. Undue preference.</p>

<p>The complaint that railway rates are excessive generally takes
the shape of a comparison of the charges on some foreign railway.
Now, I confess that it is very difficult to meet such allegations, because
of the difficulty of presenting all the conditions of which account
must be taken in order to make a fair and sound comparison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and also owing to the absence of adequate data or materials in the
published statistics of English railways.</p>

<p>A general allegation that English rates are higher than those
charged in some countries cannot even be discussed, because the
factors needed for the comparison are not available. Are they in
fact higher is a question the answer to which must precede discussion
as to reasons and explanations. The facts in regard to the
average length of haul, the average rate per ton mile for different
kinds of traffic, or the average charge per passenger mile, and general
information as to the nature of commodities carried, speed of
transit, and services rendered for the rates charged must be
ascertained before any comparison is possible, and these facts are
not ascertainable for English railways.</p>

<p>My belief is that having regard to the capital expended on construction
of railways, English railway rates are not excessive for
the services rendered, and I greatly doubt whether, after making
proper allowances for differences in capital cost of railway accommodation,
and for other essentially different conditions, rates in
any country are lower, comparing like with like, than railway rates
in England. This is an issue of fact. It lies at the threshold of
any inquiry into the subject of railway rates, and I confess I do not
see how much progress can be made with any discussion which turns
on assertions as to the relative dearness of English railway rates
until adequate materials are available for a sound comparison.</p>

<p>It is true beyond question that English railways have cost more
to construct than the railways of any other country. The capital
expenditure of all railways in England is represented by the figure
of about £56,000 per mile as compared with about £21,000, which
is the corresponding figure for German railways, and about £12,000
per mile for American railways. Railway proprietors in England
are not responsible for the high capital cost. They were forced by
law, and by custom powerful as law, to pay monstrously inflated
values for their lands. Burden upon burden has been heaped upon
them by the action of the Legislature, by the requirements of Government
departments, and by the exactions of public opinion. They
have borne heavy losses in being compelled to spend capital without
regard to their ability to secure adequate return upon it, and assuredly
no reckoning is due from them to the public in this matter.
The reverse would be more true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The total capitalization of railways in the United Kingdom in
the year 1907, as given in the Board of Trade Returns, was 1,294
millions sterling, of which 196 millions represents nominal additions.
The net earnings (some of which, however, arose from miscellaneous
sources independent of the operation of the railways)
amounted to £44,940,000, or 3.47 per cent on the nominal capital.
Out of a total of 1,294 millions sterling, 136 millions of loan and
preferential capital received interest or dividends in excess of
4 per cent. This presumably arose from the insecurity of capital,
involving the payment of a high rate of interest or dividend. One
hundred and eighty-one millions of ordinary capital received dividends
in excess of 4 per cent. per annum. The capital receiving interest
or dividends in excess of 4 per cent. per annum is, therefore,
317 millions, or 24.5 per cent. of the total. It cannot be said on
these figures that the interest received by those who provided the
capital for the railways is excessive.</p>

<p>But would it be possible for State railways to reduce the amount
included in railway rates for interest and dividends? It cannot be
denied that our present system does involve the needless duplication
of railway accommodation&mdash;the inevitable waste of competition.
There is the constant endeavor to divert traffic, the corresponding
effort to keep it. Capital is wasted, but public facilities are increased.
The public could certainly secure by monopoly the saving
of waste, but only at the cost of losing the advantages, such
as they are, of getting more than they pay for. I suspect that
on a broad and comprehensive view these advantages are not worth
to the community the waste of capital involved in providing them.
But it is rather late in the day to adopt this view. Enormous
waste has already been incurred, and it must be remembered that
this drain on the resources of the nation is not likely to be so
serious in the future as it has been in the past, even if the system
of leaving railways to private enterprise is not abandoned.</p>

<p>The private ownership of railways provides for the absorption
of the wastage of capital in a manner which would be impossible
under State ownership. Eighty-eight millions of the capital expenditure
on railways goes without dividend, and 151 millions has
to be content with a return less than 2 per cent per annum. Although
this undoubtedly represents a loss to the community, the
loss is distributed. It falls on those who voluntarily spent their
money in the hope of gain, and lost it. The State cannot lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
capital in this way. All expenditure incurred by the State would be
represented by money borrowed on the public credit, and the interest
would have to be paid in full, whether the expenditure proved
remunerative or the reverse.</p>

<p>That there would be savings, and large savings, under State
management I would not deny, but that is because the railways
would be worked as a monopoly, and not because they would be
worked by the State. The same and still larger economies in working
could be effected under private enterprise if competition were
abandoned in favor of universal combination or monopoly. The
whole question depends on the waste of competition. Each railway
company works for its own route. The result is that unnecessary
train mileage is run, and train loads are lessened. The
secret of success, the foundation of all economy in railway working,
lies in securing the largest possible train loads. This is a
simple rule, but it embodies a universal truth. If those responsible
for the handling and carriage of railway traffic could work with a
single eye to economical results, and in all cases forward traffic
by the routes which yielded the best working results, great economies
could undoubtedly be effected. This consideration does indicate
that a source of improvements in railway results would be open to a
railway system under Government management which is not available
for privately owned railways competing with one another.
And in fairness one must admit that this source of economy obtainable
only under the conditions of monopoly must be set down
as a point to the credit of State ownership.</p>

<p>Many of the complaints against railway rates as excessive are
really, when analyzed, complaints of undue preference. They are
based on comparisons with other rates, and, in nearly every case,
it is the factor of competition which lies at the root of the difficulty.
This is the natural result of our mixed system of competition
and control. In principle all would admit that there should
be equal treatment on railways. But what is and what ought to be
equality are questions in regard to which there is much room for
difference of opinion.</p>

<p>To what extent does the law really require equality? The Railway
and Canal Traffic Act, 1888, enacts in substance that a railway
company shall not make any difference in the treatment of traders
which shall amount to an undue preference. It permits the grouping
of places situated at various places from any point of destina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>tion
or departure of merchandise, provided that the distances shall
not be unreasonable, and that the rates charged and the places
grouped together shall not be so grouped as to create an undue
preference. Now, in this legislation there is no definite or tangible
principle. The Legislature has not really made up its mind how
traders should be treated. It simply says that any preference given
to one trader over another shall not be undue, but the interpretation
of the word undue is left open. The prohibition of undue
preference only applies to the actions of one company on its own
railway, and, therefore, covers but a small part of the matter. A
trader desiring to have his goods sent to some market which is
prejudiced by the competition of goods carried to the same market
from some other place by some other railway which, for some
reason or other, good or bad, gives better treatment to its customers&mdash;a
prejudice far more likely to happen, in fact, than one
arising from differences in treatment on the same railway&mdash;is not
protected or assisted by any legislation.</p>

<p>The question may be asked whether national railways would or
could cure this somewhat indefinite position?</p>

<p>If railways were nationalized, would it not be necessary, and
would it be practicable to settle the principles to be applied in treating
different districts in competition with one another? At present
there are no principles if the districts are served by different railways.
If one railway serves two districts, the law provides that
such railway shall not mete out unequal treatment so as to constitute
undue preference, whatever that may mean, but if these
two competing districts are served by different railways, the law
shrinks from any interference.</p>

<p>Now, in practically every case the favorable treatment complained
of, due or undue, as the case may be, is forced upon the
railway company by competition in some shape or other. It may
be competition of other carriers by sea or by land, or it may be
the necessity for enabling one district to compete with another less
favorably situated. Such consideration for the commercial needs
of districts in relatively advantageous positions is permitted and
encouraged when it is afforded by different railways, though rendered
difficult when one railway serves the competing districts.
What would State railways do? If the law of undue preference
now operative within the limits of particular railway systems became,
by reason of State ownership, applicable to all railways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
there would be a stupendous disturbance of existing trading conditions.
Instead of State purchase diminishing the complaints of
undue preference, it would be the signal for the commencement
of fierce conflicts between districts. It would be necessary to face
the question whether and to what extent geographical advantage
of position should be recognized in fixing railway rates. The
centers of production and consumption in England have been fixed
away back in commercial history, and from a railway point of view
these have largely to be taken as facts beyond control. Facilities
for reaching the populous centers of consumption are of vital importance
to producers and importers. Would State railways be
compelled by the pressure of interested landowners and others to
fix rates for agricultural produce and manufactured articles and
for import and export trade rigidly in proportion to distance?</p>

<p>It is probable that a bitter controversy would arise on the question,
and discontent with the railway arrangements which have
gradually, and with very general approval, been established in England,
instead of being lessened, would be greatly extended if we embarked
on the experiment of State ownership.</p>

<p>Would the management of railways by Government officials be,
on the whole, better than management by the officers of private
corporations working for profit?</p>

<p>That is the question which lies at the root of the subject which
we are discussing. So far as I am concerned, I have no inclination
to jibe at the management of those enterprises which are conducted
by the State and municipal bodies. I do not think that the
postal services would be better managed if they were under private
control, probably not so well. Municipal tramways show the weakness
of public management, chiefly in the tendency towards fixing
charges at figures which sacrifice the interests of ratepayers to the
interests of the working classes who possess votes, but who generally
occupy houses in respect of which they do not directly pay
rates. That there would be very grave risks in substituting State
management for commercial management of railways must, I think,
be generally admitted.</p>

<p>But some of the principal arguments against municipal trading do
not seem to me to apply to the working of railways by the State.
Of course, the objection of those who think that no public authority
should become directly responsible for the management of any
commercial undertaking is as valid against State working of rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>ways
as against municipal working of tramways, or municipal
supply of electricity for light and power. In both cases there is a
restriction of the field of private enterprise, and that is enough for
the out-and-out Individualist. He is convinced, on general grounds,
that all commercial undertakings should be left exclusively to private
enterprise. But those who are not prepared to settle such matters
on any general theory, and who prefer to weigh the advantages
and disadvantages in each case, see that many of the reasons against
municipal trading cannot fairly be urged against the national ownership
of railways. Municipal trading is indefensible because it
unfairly competes with private traders. Competition in commerce
must be fair competition on equal terms, otherwise it fails to secure
any of the economic advantages which do undoubtedly flow from
the free competition of private traders. A commercial undertaking
must be worked for a commercial profit. A municipality raises
money on public credit, and thus gains an advantage over every
private competitor. It also fixes scales of charges and rates of
wages without reference, or, at all events, without exclusive reference,
to considerations of profit, and thus makes it impossible for
any competing trader to earn a legitimate commercial profit. And
to make it possible to do this it uses the power of taxation, and
levies rates on the competing traders themselves, so that the municipal
business can be carried on without the commercial profit which
the private trader must earn in order to live. No one can say
that this is fair competition.</p>

<p>Then municipal bodies are, from their composition, unsuitable
for carrying on commercial business. Their organization cannot
be adapted to commercial management. The individuals who serve
on these bodies have neither the time nor, as a collective body, the
capacity for managing the business on which they embark with
efficiency and success. The difference in results due to the difference
between good and bad management is paid for out of the
rates.</p>

<p>These considerations do not, however, apply with equal force
to the State management of railways. The State would have a
complete and universal monopoly. There would be no private
competition left, except, of course, competition by sea or by tramway
or any other mode of conveyance which can compete with
railways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there would not be, it may be assumed, any body like a
municipal council who would practically interfere with the management.
There might be Advisory Councils, like the Prussian State
Railway Councils, and, of course, there would be a Minister of
State responsible to Parliament for the railway administration, and
Parliament itself, already, one may remark in passing, clogged and
overburdened with work. But it is certain that whatever the details
of the organization adopted might be, the whole of the management
would practically be left to the expert permanent officials
of the railways. There is no reason to doubt that railway officers
would serve the State with as much loyalty and with as great a
measure of success as they now serve the proprietors. Instead of
being responsible to boards of directors and shareholders, they
would be responsible to a certain number of officers of State, probably,
indeed necessarily, to a large extent recruited from their own
ranks, and I do not think that the change would result in much
practical difference so far as the work of those who really carry
out the duties of management are concerned. The only difference
would be that these officers would have in view that they were
working for the State instead of for shareholders.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that if railways were nationalized they
would be used as a field for many kinds of social experiments. The
combination of philanthropy with business is generally regarded
with suspicion, but the conversion of the railway manager into a
social reformer would, I think, arouse serious and legitimate alarm.
The certainty which we now possess that the action of any railway
company, whether it be wise or foolish in itself, is wholly commercial
in its motives and its aims, is a valuable safeguard. But
if railway policy were to become the medium for the promotion of
social or even economic theories under the guidance of politicians,
would not this be a most alarming peril to trading and industrial
interests? One group might insist, by political pressure, that the
standard of wages should be maintained at a higher level than
could be commercially justified. Another group, or many groups,
might devote their efforts to securing the construction of railways
in districts which could not support them with sufficient traffic, with
the result of burdening the railway system with many unremunerative
branches for which either traders, passengers, or the taxpayers
throughout the country would have to pay. The policy of others
would be to make suburban railways at enormous cost, and run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
cheap trains to serve the population resident in large cities, regardless
whether such railways or trains were self-supporting or not.
In this policy they would have the ardent and influential support
of the owners of suburban land, who would rejoice in the increase
of their rents, brought about by the expenditure of public money
in creating railway facilities on uncommercial terms. These are
not fanciful dangers. They are the results which we may feel
sure would inevitably follow the nationalization of our railways,
and the advantages to be gained from State management would need
to be very great to compensate for these burdens.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the question which requires the gravest consideration
is that which concerns the position of the State as an
employer of labor. There are upwards of 620,000 railway officers
and servants. The State would become the direct employer of
that huge army, and would have to settle all questions relating to
hours, wages, and other conditions of service. If a railway company
is unable to settle differences with its men the ultimate resort
of the men is the withdrawal of their labor, whilst the company
are free to employ other men who are willing to accept their conditions
of employment. Any railway strike on a large scale is a
dire calamity to trade and to the public, but if one were compelled
to consider the possibility of a general strike on a national railway
system, even the deplorable results which accompany strikes on
privately-owned railways would seem comparatively insignificant.
Probably a railway department of Government would not urge the
adoption of compulsory arbitration, if they were themselves concerned,
with as much equanimity as they do in the case of strikes
on private railways. It is true that in this matter the advocates of
State railways can point to the comparative absence of labor conflicts
in connection with the services now under Government control,
but municipal undertakings have not been so successful in
avoiding labor disputes, and in many cases have secured even the
degree of immunity from such conflicts which they enjoy by the
concession of terms of employment which constitute heavy burdens
on the ratepayers. It seems to me that the danger of serious labor
disputes cannot be put aside, and I confess that I am unable to see
any safe way of meeting the objection to State ownership on the
ground that the State ought to limit, as far as possible, its liability
to become directly concerned in such disputes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion, I would say that I have felt unable to take up a
partisan attitude on the question. For many years past both my
studies on railway subjects and my practical experience have led
me to a convinced belief in the advantages of well-regulated
monopoly, and I am unable wholly to disapprove of a scheme which
would secure for the country the advantages of a system of well-regulated
monopoly in which I believe, even although it should come
in the guise of State ownership.</p>

<p>Competition, in my judgment, creates more evils than it cures,
especially the half-hearted and imperfect competition which exists
in England so far as railways are concerned, which cannot be regarded
as free competition on a commercial basis.</p>

<p>I recognize that it is impracticable to secure unification or any
very extensive or far-reaching combinations of railways under our
system of private ownership. The public would not tolerate uncontrolled
railways under private management, and I doubt whether
any form of control which has yet been devised, or is likely to be
devised, combined with partial competition, can give entirely satisfactory
results. That there are grave dangers and risks in the
public ownership of railways I fully admit; indeed, so grave are
they, that I think he would be a very bold minister who would
venture to bring forward, under Government sanction, a proposal
for the nationalization of our railways. The existence of such a
huge amount of Government patronage would open the door to
political corruption. The existence of such an enormous body of
Government servants possessing the franchise&mdash;and I confess it
seems to me impracticable to hope that any measure could be carried
subject to disfranchisement of Government servants&mdash;would imperil
the financial stability of the railway system, and introduce
new and very serious sources of weakness and danger into the
body politic.</p>

<p>The risk of loss from the charging of unduly low rates under
pressure from the influential body of traders seeking to enrich themselves
at the expense of the general community seems to me a risk
which no thoughtful man can ignore. No expedients for checking
and restraining political influence so that it could not reach or sway
the decision of the officers of State responsible for railway management
seem to me practicable under our democratic constitution.</p>

<p>If the nation owns the railways, the nation must take all the
risks of State ownership, and we could only trust that the existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
purity of our politics and the common sense, honorable character,
and long experience in self-government of the English people would
suffice to protect the commonwealth from these perils resulting in
serious harm. But whatever may be the issue of the consideration
of the question of State purchase of railways, I am prepared to
believe that English railways will continue, whether under State
management or under private management, to deserve the praise
which Mr. W. M. Acworth expressed in his recent address as
President of the Economic Section of the British Association in
Dublin, by saying that in his judgment&mdash;after, I may remind you,
a fuller study of railway conditions in all countries of the world
than has been given to the subject of many men in England&mdash;that
"English railways are, on the whole, among the best, if not actually
the best, in the world."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">February 8, 1909.</span>&mdash;Ordered to be printed.</p>

<p class="center">Mr. <span class="smcap">Elkins</span>, from the Committee on Interstate Commerce, submitted
the following</p>

<p class="pfs120">ADVERSE REPORT.</p>

<p class="center">[To accompany S. 423.]</p>


<p>The Committee on Interstate Commerce, to which was referred
Senate bill 423 "To amend section 6 of an act entitled 'An act to
regulate commerce,' approved February fourth, eighteen hundred
and eighty-seven, and acts amendatory thereof," respectfully reports
said bill adversely, and recommends its indefinite postponement.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed to section 6 will be found on page 4,
commencing on line 10, and ending on page 5, on line 8, of the bill,
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Provided further</em>, That at any time prior to the expiration of the notice
herein required to be given of a proposed increase of rates, fares, or
charges, or of joint rates, fares, or charges, any shipper or any number of
shippers, jointly or severally, may file with the commission a protest, in
writing, against the proposed increase in whole or in part, stating succinctly
the grounds of his or their objections to the proposed change. The filing
of such protest shall operate to continue in force the then existing rate or
rates, fare or fares, charge or charges, proposed to be changed and protested
against as aforesaid, until the reasonableness of the rate or rates,
fare or fares, charge or charges, proposed to be substituted shall have been
determined by the commission. Upon the filing of such protest, a copy
thereof shall be mailed by the Secretary of the commission to the carrier
or carriers proposing the change and thereafter the commission shall proceed
to hear and determine the matter in all respects as it is required to do
by sections thirteen and fifteen of this act, in case of a complaint made
because of anything done or omitted to be done by any common carrier, as
provided in said section thirteen; but throughout the proceeding, the burden
of proof shall be on the carrier proposing the change to show that
the rate, fare or charge proposed to be substituted is just and reasonable.</p></div>

<p>An amendment was offered in the committee which would modify
the original proposition of the amendment, by leaving it to the discretion
of the Interstate Commerce Commission, upon the filing of
a protest against the proposed increase of rates, to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
whether the schedule filed should go into effect at the end of thirty
days or should be suspended by order of the commission until after
final hearing, upon the question as to whether the advance was reasonable.</p>

<p>This proposed amendment to the amendment of the 6th section,
although somewhat modifying its effect, did not alter the principle
upon which the original amendment rested, or remove the objections
that influenced the committee in reporting the bill adversely. The
reasons which control the action of the committee may be briefly
stated as follows:</p>


<p class="pfs80">REVIEW OF QUESTION BEFORE COMMITTEE.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp; From 1887 Congress, by the act then passed "to regulate commerce"
through all of its amendments to that act, including the act
of June 29, 1906 (which was passed after the most elaborate investigation
of the entire subject and the fullest debate), has adhered
to a fixed policy in its legislation upon this subject. It has declared
its constitutional right to regulate the transportation of persons and
property in interstate and foreign commerce, while, at the same
time, it has recognized the right of the owners of the instrumentalities
of commerce to control and manage their properties subject to
the supervision and limitation imposed by the regulating statute,
that the charges, fares and rates must be fair, just, and reasonable;
that neither discrimination as to person or place must be found in
the schedules; and that no device of any character should result in
unlawful preference between shippers.</p>

<p>It has in all these acts recognized the right of the responsible
managers of the transportation interests of the country to fix the
rates for transportation, as upon its revenue must rest the efficiency
of its service to the public and the value of its property to its holders,
subject only to those wise limitations which prohibit the exercise
of these property rights to the injury of the public. Congress
has appreciated the magnitude of the vast interest affected by such
legislation. With 230,000 miles of track, with millions of rates
published in accordance with the statute, with changes of rates numbering
between 600 and 700 a day, and reaching the enormous sum
of 225,000 a year, it has, with the practical experience of twenty-two
years, refused to take the initiation of rates from the carrier and
impose it upon its administrative tribunal. Congress and the
Supreme Court have adopted the construction of the act to regulate
commerce, announced by Judge Jackson (Interstate Commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Commission <em>v.</em> B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., 43 Fed. Rep., 37, and affirmed,
145 U. S., 263):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Subject to the two leading prohibitions that their charges shall not be
unjust or unreasonable, and that they shall not unjustly discriminate, so as
to give undue preference or disadvantage to persons or traffic similarly
circumstanced, the act to regulate commerce leaves common carriers as they
were at the common law, free to make special contracts looking to the
increase of their business, to classify their traffic, to adjust and apportion
their rates so as to meet the necessities of commerce, same principles, which
are regarded as sound, and adopted in other trades and pursuits.</p></div>

<p>This policy, we believe, has been approved by the country during
that period. Pending the elaborate investigation of this subject
prior to the passage of the act of June 29, 1906, no crystallized sentiment
was manifested, either in the press or during the hearings,
that indicated a public sentiment that this policy should be departed
from. Since this bill has been before your committee no such public
sentiment has been shown to exist by those who appeared before it.</p>

<p>The conferring upon the commission the power to suspend a rate
advanced, either upon the filing of a protest by a shipper or in the
discretion of the commission, taken in connection with the provision
of the statute which gives to the commission the power to fix a rate
and to designate the time, not longer than two years, that it should
remain in force, would ultimately turn over to that administrative
body the function of initiating the rates of the entire country. It
would offer a premium to every shipper to enter a protest to the
advance of rates, whether they were reasonable or unreasonable,
even if discretion was vested in the commission. The protest, prepared
by skilled attorneys, presenting a prima facie case of unreasonable
advance of the rate, with no opportunity for an investigation
before it must be acted upon, an official body, on which was imposed
the responsibility to act would be constrained to suspend the rate
until a final determination of the complaint.</p>

<p>The existing law permits any shipper to protest any rate that has
gone into effect, the hearing on the protest is made without formal
pleadings, and the commission is authorized then to determine the
question whether the rate put in effect by the carrier was a reasonable
rate or not, and, if not, to make the rate reasonable. So far, in
the practical operation of the act of June 29, 1906, this provision of
law has worked satisfactorily, and but comparatively few of the
decisions of the commission have been contested by the carriers.
Under existing law both parties are protected. If the decision is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that the rate is unreasonable a judgment may be rendered in favor
of the protestant for the difference between what the commissioners
determine is a reasonable rate and the rate fixed by the carrier, with
6 per cent interest from the date of the overcharge. If, on the other
hand, this amendment should receive the approval of Congress and
the rate filed by the carrier should be protested and then suspended
by the commission (in the multiplicity of duties imposed upon
that tribunal), considerable time would elapse before a final determination
of the question could be reached. During that period the
carrier would be receiving only the old rate, and if the commission
finally decided that the advance was reasonable no reparation in any
way could be awarded.</p>

<p>It was alleged before the committee that this last result would not
be very injurious to the carrier, for the reason that it would be
receiving the rate which it had fixed as a fair compensation for the
service performed prior to the change. The answer to this seems
reasonable, which was, that conditions had so changed that it
required an advance of the rate to meet those new conditions. Otherwise
the advanced rate would have no justification. That traffic
officials fully appreciate the fact that, with the watchful eyes of
every shipper affected by an advanced rate and the authority of the
commission to determine and fix a just and reasonable rate (as a
general rule), rates would not be advanced by such officials without
a belief upon their part that there were sufficient reasons to sustain
them, if protested.</p>

<p>The attention of the committee has been called to the attitude of
the commission in its rulings upon the advance of rates, even where
the facts have shown that the rates have been lowered with a view
of developing a particular industry. In the case of the New Albany
Furniture Company against Mobile, Jackson and Kansas City Railroad
Company, etc., decided June 2, 1908, the commission held:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The rates were low before the increase, but having been established,
after prolonged negotiations, especially for the purpose of permitting complainant
to reach a particular market, and in preference to making a readjustment
in some other direction or territory, and complainant having adjusted
its business thereto, defendants may not by an arbitrary advance in
those rates destroy complainant's business, there being no evidence that
the rates advanced were less than the cost of service."</p></div>

<p>A similar decision was rendered on the 1st of June in the case of
Western Oregon Lumber Manufacturers' Association against the
Southern Pacific Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Knowledge of the views held by the commission by the traffic officials
and shippers will serve as the most effective check upon the
part of the carrier in advancing rates over those which have been in
existence for any considerable period of time, unless they can support
the advance by the most satisfactory reasons.</p>


<p class="pfs80">WOULD THE AMENDMENT PROPOSED BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE FIFTH
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION?</p>

<p>2. &nbsp; An objection urged to the approval of this amendment, even
though modified as suggested in committee, was that it conflicted
with the fifth amendment in depriving the carrier of its property
without due process of law.</p>

<p>The existing law authorizes carriers to make reasonable rates.
Congress recognizing the right of control by the carrier has provided
reasonable regulations to safeguard the interests of the public
in the exercise of that right. It authorizes a protest after the rate
had gone into effect; it provides for a full hearing after notice by
the commission; it has further extended the time when the rate
shall be made effective to thirty days from the filing of the schedule
with the commission. These were held to be reasonable regulations,
but it is claimed that under the amendment proposed to the sixth
section, that if the rate is suspended from going into effect at the
end of the thirty days by a protest, there is no limitation in the act
fixing the time when the commission shall determine the question of
the reasonableness of the advance; that the period is therefore indefinite,
depending upon numerous considerations which might extend
the time when the rate would be effective, if it was finally held to
be reasonable, to six months or a year.</p>

<p>That the act of suspension either by the operation of the statute
or by the commission is without notice or hearing to the carrier;
that Congress has no greater right to authorize an administrative
tribunal to suspend indefinitely the taking effect of a reasonable rate
without notice or hearing than it has the right to provide that an
administrative tribunal may authorize a rate which would yield less
than the cost of the service.</p>

<p>It was decided in the case of Chicago, M. &amp; St. P. R. R. Co.
against Minnesota, 134 U. S., 418, that the right to make a reasonable
rate was a property right. In the case of Interstate Commerce
Commission <em>v.</em> Chicago Great Western Ry., 209 U. S., 118, the
Supreme Court said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It must be remembered that railroads are the private property of their
owners; that while from the public character of the work in which they are
engaged the public has the power to prescribe rules for securing faithful
and efficient service and equality between shippers and communities, yet in
no proper sense is the public a general manager."</p></div>

<p>Justice Brewer, in the above case, page 108, speaking for the court
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It must also be remembered that there is no presumption of wrong
arising from a change of rate by a carrier. The presumption of honest
intent and right conduct attends the action of carriers as well as it does
the action of other corporations or individuals in their transactions in life.
Undoubtedly when rates are changed the carrier making the change must,
when properly called upon, be able to give a good reason therefor, but the
mere fact that a rate has been raised carries with it no presumption that it
was not rightfully done. Those presumptions of good faith and integrity
which have been recognized for ages as attending human action have not
been overthrown by any legislation in respect to common carriers."</p></div>

<p>It is claimed that the indefinite suspension of the rate until final
hearing is to deprive the carrier, if the rate advanced is reasonable,
of its right of property during the period of suspension, without
having given it any opportunity to be heard prior to the act of
suspension. Due process of law must precede, and should not follow,
the suspension. To set aside the carrier's act in fixing the rate
pending the investigation required by due process of law is to deprive
the carrier, pro tanto, of its property right to charge a reasonable
rate. The fact that the statute requires an investigation after the
suspension of the rate does not avoid the constitutional inhibition,
as that provision can only be satisfied when the investigation precedes
any disturbance of property rights. The carrier is entitled to
the investigation before it is restrained in the <em>exercise</em> of its property
rights; the theory of the amendment suggested is that the shipper is
entitled to an investigation before the carrier can <em>exercise</em> its property
rights.</p>

<p>Those contending for this objection to the amendment assumed
that the indefinite suspension without hearing of the act of the carrier
which deprived it, beyond a reasonable time, of the benefit of
the advanced rate, was in effect the same as that which was condemned
by the Supreme Court in the case of the Chicago, M. &amp; St.
P. R. R. Co. against Minnesota. Under the statute of that State, a
carrier had the right to initiate the rate, and to put it in effect, and,
under the law, the commission was authorized to make such changes
as it deemed proper in the schedule so filed, and to direct the carrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to modify or change the schedule in accordance with the decision of
the tribunal. In the one case the going into effect of the rate is suspended
indefinitely without notice or hearing; in the other, the rate is
changed or modified without hearing. On page 418 the court condemns
this in the following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No hearing is provided for, no summons or notice to the company before
the commission has found what it is to find and declared what it is to
declare, no opportunity provided for the company to introduce witnesses
before the commission, in fact, nothing which has the semblance of the
process of law."</p></div>

<p>On page 458 the court said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If the company is deprived of the power of charging reasonable rates
for the use of its property, and such deprivation takes place in the absence
of an investigation by judicial machinery, it is deprived of the lawful
use of its property, and thus, in substance and effect of the property itself
without due process of law and in violation of the Constitution of the
United States."</p></div>

<p>This view of the law as announced in 134 U. S. was affirmed by
the Supreme Court in the case of Louisville and Nashville Co.
against Kentucky, 183 U. S., 510.</p>

<p>It was further suggested that if this amendment was incorporated
in the sixth section, that it was so fundamental in its character, that
if the court should hold that it was an unconstitutional exercise of
power by Congress, that it might have the effect of destroying the
entire value of this remedial legislation, as it would be impossible to
separate the clause from those provisions of the law directly controlling
the subject of rates.</p>

<p>The committee, without expressing any opinion upon the constitutional
questions suggested, feels that it is of sufficient importance
and gravity to cause it to hesitate to incorporate such amendment
into the sixth section, especially in view of the other objections to
such legislation.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COULD THE COMMISSION, UNDER THE AMENDMENT, FIX A REASONABLE
RATE, IF IT HELD THE PROPOSED ADVANCE RATE UNREASONABLE?</p>

<p>3. &nbsp; One of the most serious objections to this measure, if the contentions
of those who oppose it are well founded, is the assertion
that the adoption of this amendment would, in reference to advanced
rates that were protested, deprive the commission of the power conferred
upon it by the fifteenth section of the act of June 29, 1906,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
empowering it, if on protest and hearing it found a rate to be
unreasonable, to fix a reasonable rate.</p>

<p>The authority to the commission proposed in the amendment "to
hear and determine the matter in all respects as it was required to
do by sections 13 and 15 of this act," can only be construed to refer
to the procedure as provided in the thirteenth and fifteenth sections
of the interstate commerce law. There is no attempt to amend the
provisions of section 15, which confers upon the commission the
right to declare a rate unreasonable, and when so declared to fix a
reasonable rate. There are no provisions found in the amendment
suggested to the sixth section conferring upon the commission the
power, when it finds a rate proposed to be advanced unreasonable,
that it may then proceed to fix a reasonable rate.</p>

<p>An examination of section 15 in reference to the power of the
commission to fix a rate depends upon a condition precedent that is
clearly set forth in said section. It is, that before the commission
has the authority to fix a rate it must first reach the opinion that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The rates, or charges whatsoever, demanded, charged, or collected by
any common carrier or carriers, * * * or that any regulation or practice
whatsoever of such carrier or carriers affecting such rates, are unreasonable,
or unjustly discriminatory, or are unduly preferential or prejudicial,
or otherwise in violation of the provisions of this act."</p></div>

<p>When this conclusion has been reached as to existing rates the
section then authorizes the commission&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable rate or
rates, charge or charges, to be thereafter observed in such cases as the
maximum to be charged; and what regulations or practice in respect to such
transportation is just, fair and reasonable to be thereafter followed."</p></div>

<p>To leave no doubt of the true construction of this section, an
examination of the order required to be entered by the commission
is conclusive of the meaning and intention of Congress in the enactment
of this portion of the fifteenth section. It provides:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And to make an order that the carrier shall cease and desist from
such violation to the extent to which the commission finds the same to
exist, and shall not thereafter publish, demand, or collect any rate or charge
for such transportation in excess of the maximum rate or charge so prescribed."</p></div>

<p>An analysis of this order of the commission which requires it to
provide "that the carrier shall cease and desist from such violation,
to the extent to which the commission finds the same to exist," recognizes
the fact that the rate is an existing rate, is an effective rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
is a rate in full operation, and cannot, therefore, be applied under
the provisions of the amendment suggested to the sixth section, as
no rate has gone into effect and become operative.</p>

<p>The subject we are considering as affected by the proposed amendment
and the provisions of the fifteenth section, do not rest upon
any principle of the common law, but are purely statutory enactments
to carry out a policy in reference to interstate commerce
deemed wise by Congress. The construction, therefore, of the statute
in this respect cannot be aided by any principles of the common
law, and the conclusion as to its meaning must rest entirely upon the
intention of the legislature as expressed by the language of the act.</p>

<p>If this view of the fifteenth section is correct, the adoption of the
amendment to the sixth section would change one of the most effective
provisions of the act of June 29, 1906, and which was contended
for with such earnestness in its passage through Congress.</p>

<p>Under the amendment to the sixth section, if adopted, and a protest
was made to the advanced rate, or the commission under a protest
was authorized in its discretion to suspend the advanced rate,
until hearing as to its reasonableness, the only decision that could be
made under that amendment would be, that the rate proposed to be
advanced was either reasonable or unreasonable, but there would
exist no power in the commission, if they found the rate unreasonable,
to fix what in its judgment would be a reasonable rate. The
committee does not believe that it is the desire of Congress, in view
of the sentiment of the country as expressed in the press and before
it, to pass additional legislation which would invite and suggest such
confusion and legal difficulties in the construction of an act which
has not yet been put in full operation by the tribunal charged with
that duty.</p>


<p class="pfs80">COULD THE DECISION OF THE COMMISSION, CONDEMNING AN ADVANCE
OF RATES, BE REVIEWED BY THE COURTS?</p>

<p>4. &nbsp; It was suggested to the committee that the incorporation of
this amendment to the sixth section of the act of June 29, 1906,
would deprive the carrier of the right to review by a bill in equity a
decision of the commission which denied to the carrier the right to
advance a rate. This contention is based upon the ruling of the
courts, that the making of a future rate is a legislative act, and not
a question for judicial review, and that until the rate is fixed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
becomes effective it is purely one within the legislative function, and
presents no subject cognizable by the court.</p>

<p>Under the amendment proposed a carrier would file a schedule of
advanced rates; a shipper enters a protest to the rate taking effect;
either by operation of the statute or the exercise of discretion by
the commission, the rate is suspended until final hearing; subsequently
there is a notice of the hearing and a decision rendered
adverse to the contention of the carrier seeking an advance of the
rate. Under these circumstances there is no remedy of review of
that act of the commission provided for by existing law or under
the principles of equity.</p>

<p>Existing law, providing for a review of a decision of the commission,
does not by its terms enlarge the subject of equitable jurisdiction.
The provision of the statute confers upon the court the right
to take jurisdiction of a case against the commission and to review
its decision when based upon an existing rate. There is no provision
of the statute that contemplates the exercise of a jurisdiction by the
courts in a case arising under a provision of law similar to the
amendment sought to the sixth section of the act of June 29, 1906.
In the decision rendered by the commission denying the right to
advance the rate, the question of the reasonableness of the former
rate or of any existing rate is not involved in the order to be entered
by the commission. Under this proposed amendment the carrier
submits a proposition to advance the rate, which has never become
effective. The order of the commission would simply approve the
proposition or deny the advance of the rate. This, under the proposed
amendment, would be the extent of the authority and act of
the commission.</p>

<p>In the case of McChord <em>v.</em> L. &amp; N. R. R. Co. (183 U. S., 483),
followed by the case of L. &amp; N. R. R. Co. <em>v.</em> Ky. (183 U. S., 503),
the court sustains the doctrine announced, and held that before a
court of equity can intervene, the administrative body must do some
act that advances beyond the legislative function. (Reagan <em>v.</em> Farmers'
Loan &amp; Trust Co., 154 U. S., 362; Interstate Commerce Commission
<em>v.</em> Railway Co., 167 U. S., 479.)</p>

<p>It is contended that the decision of the commission prohibiting
the advance is a legislative act, and that under the decisions of the
courts the order simply prohibiting the taking effect of a proposed
advance could not be the subject of equitable cognizance. If this
view is not correct, it is contended that the courts by overruling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
order of the commission would in effect be putting in force a future
rate. Under existing law, however, if the rate has taken effect its
reasonableness is a matter of judicial review, and should the commission
after protest and hearing declare it to be an unreasonable
rate and set the same aside in its order, that decision is reviewable
by the courts, as it presents a judicial question. The statute conferring
upon the commission the power to determine whether an
existing rate is reasonable or unreasonable has fixed the standard
which must determine the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal,
and the courts have a right to review the act of the commission, with
a view of ascertaining whether it has acted within the limitations of
the power conferred upon it.</p>

<p>In the case of the State Corporation Commission of Virginia
against Railways, decided by Mr. Justice Holmes November 30,
1908, speaking of the power of the commission to fix a rate and the
appeal from its decision to the court of appeals of Virginia, the
court said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A judicial inquiry investigates, declares, and enforces liabilities as they
stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist.
That is its purpose and end. Legislation, on the other hand, looks to the
future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied
thereafter to all or some parts of those subject to its power. The establishment
of a rate is the making of a rule for the future, and therefore
is an act legislative, not judicial, in kind. * * *</p>

<p>"Proceedings legislative in nature are not proceedings in a court within
the meaning of the Revised Statutes, section 720, no matter what may be the
general or dominant character of the body in which they may take place.
* * * That question depends not upon the character of the body, but
upon the character of the proceedings. (Ex parte Va., 100; U. S., 339-348.)
They are not a suit in which a writ of error would lie under Revised
Statutes, section 709, and act of February 18, 1875. (C. 80 Stat., 318.)
* * * Litigation can not arise until the moment of legislation is passed.
* * * We may add that when the rate is fixed a bill against the commission
to restrain the members from enforcing it will not be bad as an
attempt to enjoin legislation or as a suit against a State, and will be the
proper form of remedy."</p></div>

<p>The recent decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Public
Service Commission <em>v.</em> Consolidated Gas Co. of New York, in which
the opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Peckham, in deciding what
is known as the Eighty-Cent Gas Case from the southern district of
New York, is instructive upon the question discussed in this objection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>In that case, the parties had gone to issue upon the question as to
whether the rate of 80 cents enjoined by the court from taking effect
was confiscatory. After deciding the case upon the merits in favor
of the commission, the court was unwilling, upon the supposed effect
of a rate which had never been in operation, to bar the parties of
their right when the same became effective from asking the protection
of the court against <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'is practical'">its practical</ins> results. The memorandum
announcing the position of the court upon that question is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As it may possibly be that a practical experience of the effect of the acts
by actual operation under them might prevent the complainant from obtaining
a fair and just return upon its property used in its business of
supplying gas, the complainant, in that event, ought to have the opportunity
of again presenting its case to the court. Therefore, the decree is reversed,
with direction to dismiss the bill without prejudice."</p></div>

<p>This case simply illustrates the fact that the court was unwilling
to decide the question finally until the rate contested had become
effective. This was a suit involving a schedule of rates, and the
question made by the record was that these rates would result in the
confiscation of the property of the complainant in violation of the
Federal Constitution. Where that question can be properly made,
the courts have intervened upon clear proof and sustained their jurisdiction
to prevent such a violation of the constitutional protection.
In this case, although the court held that the evidence developed the
fact that this allegation of the bill was not sustained, it was so reluctant
to give effect to testimony as to what might be the effect of the
rates before they were made operative that it preserved the rights of
the parties by authorizing a new suit after the rate should become
effective. Under the act to regulate commerce, such a constitutional
question could hardly be practically raised, and the rights of the
court to intervene must depend upon the limit placed upon the power
of the commission by Congress in the enactment of the law, in fixing
the standard which should guide the commission in its action.</p>


<p class="pfs80">BURDEN IMPOSED ON THE COMMISSION.&mdash;CONFLICT OF JURISDICTION.&mdash;HOW
RATES ARE MADE.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp; Your committee has deemed it proper that it should report to
the Senate the legal objections to the incorporation of this amendment
in the sixth section of the act of the 29th of June, 1906, but
although giving due weight to these objections, the committee has
been more strongly influenced in its adverse report upon this bill
because of the strong and forcible practical objections which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
been urged to the adoption of this amendment as a part of the interstate
commerce law.</p>

<p>Should this amendment become a part of the law, it would be in
the power of any shipper, whether interested or not in the result, to
file a protest against the advance of the rate which under the proposed
amendment would at once suspend its going into effect, and
under the amendment offered in committee would place it in the
power of the commission to order its suspension, if a prima facie
case was presented in the protest. The shipper in filing a protest
assumes no responsibility, either as to the effect of his action upon
the carrier or liability in any way for cost accruing during the proceeding.
Considering the thousands of articles transported by the
carriers of the country, the hundreds of thousands of rates published
for the transportation of these articles, and the thousands of
shippers interested in their movement, some idea of the number of
protests that probably would be filed on the advance of rates can be
imagined. The burden that would be thrown upon the commission
in its effort to meet this responsibility would, as Judge Cooley well
remarked, require "superhuman" efforts on its part. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Moreover, an adjudication upon a petition for relief would in many
cases be far from concluding the labors of the commission in respect to
the equities involved, for questions of rates assume new forms, and may
require to be met differently from day to day; and in those sections of the
country in which the reasons or supposed reasons for exceptional rates
are most prevalent the commission would, in effect, be required to act as rate
makers for all the roads and compelled to adjust the tariffs so as to meet
the exigencies of business while at the same time endeavoring to protect
relative rights and equities of rival carriers and rival localities. This in
any considerable State would be an enormous task. In a country so large
as ours, and with so vast a mileage of roads, it would be superhuman.
A construction of the statute which should require its performance would
render the due administration of the law altogether impracticable, and
that fact tends strongly to show that such a construction could not have
been intended."</p></div>

<p>If the advance of rates was ultimately decided to be reasonable,
the carrier would have been deprived during the period of suspension
of the additional earnings to which it was entitled, and under
such a provision of law would be required to maintain, at enormous
expense, a large force of attorneys to answer and defend these protests.
It would confer upon the commission the powers now exercised
by the courts, and the jurisdictions over the same subject by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
both the courts and the commission would necessarily produce conflict
and confusion.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court in the case of Texas Pacific R. R. Co. <em>v.</em> Abilene
Cotton Oil Co. (204 U. S., 426), construing the ninth and twenty-second
sections on the right of a shipper to apply to the courts for
pecuniary redress for an alleged unreasonable rate held that, until
the protested rate was condemned by the commission, there was no
relief in the courts. This decision avoided a conflict of jurisdiction
between the courts and the commission. It would lessen very greatly
the value of the amendment of the act of June 29, 1906, which
requires thirty days' notice in a change of rate, which was adopted,
with a view of investing rate conditions with a greater degree of stability
than formerly. Under existing law, the shipper is assured of
that degree of stability, and can predicate his sales and purchases
accordingly. Under the amendment, shippers would never know
whether or not a rate is to become effective on schedule time, or at
any future time. The effect of the amendment would, therefore, be
to a considerable degree to nullify the permanency which this amendment
to the act to regulate commerce sought to impress upon the
law.</p>

<p>We must remember in considering this question that the majority
of advances have resulted from the practice of the roads in the
reduction of rates to meet certain commercial and economic conditions
at the time, which have usually been the result of appeals from
shippers and suggestions from commercial organizations.</p>

<p>We desire to direct attention to the statement filed before the
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce upon a similar bill
to this by the chairman of the committee of the Southwestern Traffic
Association, which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A very small percentage of the changes in freight rates, either reductions
or advances, is evolved by railroad officials. Practically every change
in rates is the result of suggestion from one or more shippers, who find
that by some modification in the existing schedules their business in a
certain territory can be increased by enabling them to meet competition
which they encounter from other sources of supply, which are in most
cases served by rival railroads. Their representation is that by the proposed
change their profit or business will be increased, and consequently the
railroad serving them will share in an augmented traffic which, at the time
of the suggestion, is being handled by the rival shipper and carrier.</p>

<p>"Ninety or more per cent. of these suggestions are for reductions in
rates or for changes in rules and regulations beneficial to shippers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
classed as reductions. The railroad company is anxious at all times to
increase its traffic and gives a keen ear to such pleas of the shipper. The
railroad official to whom such requests are made carefully investigates the
conditions recited by the shipper and, by correspondence with such railroad's
representatives at the points of origin and destination, confirms, if
possible, the views of the shipper and the effect of the proposed change
on the tonnage and revenue of the company. The traffic official of the
railroad thus being daily engaged in investigations of this kind becomes very
proficient in his knowledge of the factors surrounding the movement of the
principal articles of commerce and becomes, after experience, a ready judge
of the merit of such propositions. When thus convinced, he becomes the
agent of the shipper in securing the proposed adjustment. This may take
the form of suggesting to a rival railroad that the advantage which its
shippers have enjoyed is unjust and that he should be permitted, without
any corresponding reduction on the part of such rival railroad, to reduce
his rate that the complaining shipper may profitably secure an increased
share of the competitive traffic in question. Being unable to thus persuade
the competing railroad of the merits of such a contention he is forced to
proceed by reducing his own rate without regard to the possible change
which may follow on the part of other railroads as a consequence of his
reduction.</p>

<p>"It will, therefore, naturally be seen that the railroad official and the
shipper are constantly planning to increase the business in which they are
jointly interested, to the disadvantage of the rival railroad and shipper.
Sometimes these efforts result in serious rate wars until the point in controversy
has been adjusted and the competitive rates placed on a basis
which is more nearly equitable to all concerned. In many instances these
disputes result in arbitration either by the Interstate Commerce Commission
or by individuals who may be agreed upon by the contending interests.</p>

<p>"Bearing in mind, therefore, that practically all rate reductions are the
result of the effort of the railroad company to serve the shipper, it can
easily be seen what the result will be if no advances in rates can be made
without practically the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Where it is difficult to restore rates to normal figures, the carrier will be
loath to reduce them in order that the shipper dependent upon such carrier
may increase, for the time being, his share in the competitive traffic
in which he is interested."</p></div>


<p class="pfs80">ADJUSTMENT OF RATES.&mdash;INTERRELATION OF RATES.&mdash;PRACTICAL
OPERATION OF AMENDMENT.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp; The subject of rate adjustment, even upon a single system of
transportation, is one involving great difficulty and perplexity. When
this adjustment is considered in its relation to the entire country,
to the diversified commercial conditions, as affected by commercial
competition, and as controlled by the interrelation of rates, it stands
forth as one of the most difficult of all the problems which must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
mastered that the transportation agencies may not be injuriously
crippled in the performance of their quasi public functions, or the
prosperity and development of the commercial interests be retarded
by the failure to enact proper, reasonable, and just governmental
regulations.</p>

<p>Rates which can be considered alone are comparatively few in
number. In the large majority of cases they are interrelated with
other rates, and frequently this interrelation exists as between areas
widely separated. The rates upon iron and steel from mills within
50 to 100 miles of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, whose
relations to each other are established by long custom and usage, are
based primarily upon the necessity of preserving a fair comparative
charge between the different shipping points and destinations. Rates
upon coal from central Pennsylvania to tide water have close relations
with the rates upon coal from West Virginia to tide water,
competing as such coal does, in the same markets. The rates upon
lumber from the Michigan markets must bear some relation to the
rates on lumber from Louisiana and Georgia to the same market of
distribution, although separated by hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>The rates upon grain from western farms to eastern points bear
a relation to the other, and upon export grain the rates to the Atlantic
seaboard bear a close relation to the rates to the Gulf. The rates
upon fruit and vegetable traffic from the various shipping districts,
as California on the West and Florida on the South, must be considered
in the making of rates. The structure of rates between the
territory east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio River, and
the territory east of Pittsburg and Buffalo, including New England,
is closely interrelated; as an example, the rates between Chicago and
New York take a percentage of the Chicago rate from all points
west of Pittsburg and Buffalo. The principle of the interrelation of
rates has frequently been recognized in the decisions of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.</p>

<p>In the interest of the manufacturer there is a very important relationship
between rates upon different products entering into the
manufacture of a given article. In the great steel-producing districts
of the Shenango and Mahoning valleys and Pittsburg for many
years the rates upon raw material to the furnaces for the production
of pig iron have been adjusted upon a basis, so far as possible, of
making the freight cost of assembling the raw materials that enter
into this product the same to each furnace. In the one case the rate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
upon coke may be higher and the rate upon ore or limestone lower;
in other cases the reverse. The adjustment of rates upon these different
raw materials is so made that when assembled at the different
furnaces the aggregate cost is relatively the same. This illustrates
the contention that such rates cannot be considered separately, but
must be taken as a whole.</p>

<p>Bearing these facts in mind it is manifest that if an advance in
rates is made and the protest of one shipper shall operate as a stay
to the advance of a particular rate in which he may be interested the
result would be to burden thousands of other shippers who have
made no objection. The protesting shipper would thus secure an
advantage, enjoying for a time, at least, a rate relatively lower than
that to which he was entitled. It might be urged that it would be
open to all other shippers to file similar protests, but under the provisions
of the bill, or of the amendments suggested in committee, the
protesting shipper might wait until the last day of the thirty-day
period, thus giving no opportunity to other shippers, who would be
ignorant of his purpose, to file their protest. It would be possible
if this amendment became a law that many individual shippers would
take advantage of their competitors by making contracts upon the
basis of a lower rate and at the last moment file the protest, suspend
the advance rate, and deliver their product under such contracts
within the period of the suspension of the advanced rates and
thus profit at the expense of their competitors.</p>

<p>The effect of this amendment becomes more serious where the
relation of rates is between wide areas, and these relative rate adjustments
cannot be made simultaneously. The rates upon grain for
export, from the West to the Gulf, as compared with the Atlantic
seaboard, will illustrate this statement. The protest of one shipper
between two specific points would not only result in throwing out of
relation the rates from all points in that section, but would also affect
the competitive rates from other sections. Such a result would necessarily
render the rate situation in reference to the grain rates
"confusion worse confounded."</p>

<p>Rates in a country like the United States, which is comparatively
young, and the development of which attracts the attention of the
world, must, necessarily, be elastic, not only in the interest of the
carrier, but of the shipping public. The principle is sound and
has received the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
that rates must be fixed with regard to their relations one with the
other, and not entirely upon the cost of service. This relation is
because of the competition between shippers, between sections of
shippers, and between localities, and as (because of the rapid development
of our country in the production of new sources of supply,
in the opening up of new grain fields, flour mills, mines, and factories,
etc.) this competition is constantly changing. It is manifest
that rates must constantly fluctuate, so as to be adjusted to the new
condition; it is essential in the development of the country, even in
the older sections, that rates must be elastic, which means constant
reductions and advances.</p>

<p>This is in the interest of communities and the individual shipper.
There must be elasticity for other reasons, in the interest of communities
as of the railroads; in meeting changes in commercial conditions
that necessitates reductions in rates for shorter or longer
periods, as an illustration, to enable our grain and other products of
the farm to reach foreign markets, which would be impossible in
one period unless rates were lowered, whereas in other periods
higher rates could be charged without injurious results. Understanding
the conditions that surround this complex subject, it is
manifest that if a single shipper, or even the Interstate Commerce
Commission, is to have the power to prevent at any time that elasticity
which involves an advance in rates, the natural result will be
that reductions will not be made by the carrier, and the elasticity will
be lost. The fear would be ever presented to the mind of the traffic
official that the rate once reduced could not&mdash;at least, until after
exhaustive and long-drawn-out hearings before the commission&mdash;be
advanced.</p>

<p>The necessary fluctuation in rates to meet the changing conditions
of commerce, when examined in the light of the reports of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, is startling to one not familiar with the
rapid change of commercial conditions in this country. There were
225,982 tariff publications filed with the commission in one year, all
containing changes of rates, either reductions or increases, and rules
governing transportation. These publications&mdash;many of them&mdash;contained
a great number of different tariffs. The Pennsylvania lines,
east of Pittsburg, issued 2,200 tariffs and 3,600 supplements. About
33-1/3 per cent of these covered advances, and 66-2/3 per cent were
reductions. As the law exists today, there was no special inducement
to the shipper to file protests against the advances. Suppose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
however, that this amendment had been a part of the act to regulate
commerce, how many protests would have been filed, and what
length of time would it have taken the commission to have disposed
of them? What uncertainty would have resulted to the commercial
interests while waiting for the adjudication of these questions?</p>


<p class="pfs80">OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD AND DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE AMENDMENT.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp; One of the most serious objections urged to the passage of
this amendment is the opportunity which such a law would present
for the perpetration of frauds under it, and in the case of even
honest protest to the advance of rates, where rates rest on a differential
basis, in producing thousands of instances of unfair discrimination.</p>

<p>An example under the first proposition may be stated briefly, as
follows: There are two men engaged in the same line of trade; they
are both called upon to bid on a contract involving a large amount
of a given commodity in which both deal. The carrier has given
notice of an advance in rate, effective thirty days from the filing and
publication of the schedule; the commodity is not to move for some
days; one of the bidders files his bid, based upon the advanced rate,
assuming that the notice of the carrier will be made effective; the
other shipper and bidder waits until two or three days before the
date the rate is to be made effective, files a protest, confident that
it will take three or four months to have the matter adjudicated, files
his bid against his competitor, based on the current rate, and being
the lowest, secures the contract. An example under the second
proposition would be in case of a rate published from St. Louis to
be followed differentially from Chicago by a number of competing
roads. A shipper on one of the lines, just prior to the taking effect
of the rate, would file his protest as to the rate east of Chicago. The
differential adjustment that has been made by all these roads will at
once be destroyed, and the shipper on the road against which the
protest was filed would have the advantage over all of his competitors
on the other lines in shipping east.</p>

<p>These discriminations between shippers would be the direct result
of the power placed by Congress in the hands of shippers and would
have received the sanction of legislative approval, and, therefore, be
lawful. The statute has taken it out of the power of the carrier to
meet such a condition and to prevent the discrimination. It cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
change its rate under thirty days without a special order of the commission,
and that order, it must be assumed, cannot be granted without
a reasonable hearing. Congress since 1887 has sought by the
most stringent measures of legislation to prevent discrimination and
preserve equality among shippers. The original act was demanded
more to accomplish that purpose than for any other. The Elkins
Act was confined almost entirely to the subject, and the act of June
29, 1906, increased the penalties for the violation of these provisions.
Should this policy, which has been followed for more than twenty
years, be modified and an act passed, the tendency of which is to
tempt the cupidity of the shipper to accomplish results which it has
earnestly and vigorously fought to stamp out?</p>


<p class="pfs80">WOULD PREVENT REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS ADVANCES, IN RATES, AND
DESTROY THEIR FLEXIBILITY.</p>

<p>8. &nbsp; On the face of this amendment, it seems only to give to the
commission the authority to prevent an increase in rates, but the
practical result of such a law would be far more reaching. Such a
law would mean a rigid freight tariff in place of the present flexible
and elastic system of rates which exists alone in this country. Stability
of freight rates is important, but not to the extent that the carrier
shall not feel warranted in promptly applying remedies for the
relief or assistance of shippers who find themselves no longer able
to compete, due to advantages which other shippers have secured, or
changes which have occurred in the conditions surrounding the marketing
of their products.</p>

<p>A law which tends to minimize the commercial or competitive conditions
existing at the present time will necessarily result to the disadvantage
of shippers, to the carrier, and to the communities they
serve. It is not necessary here to again refer to the presentation of
the importance of the flexibility of rates, which is so clearly shown
in the discussion of the influences which control in making reductions,
as well as advances of rates by the chairman of the Southwestern
Traffic Committee, as quoted under section 5 of this report.
The more the committee has reflected upon the probable tendency
of the principle announced by this amendment, if incorporated into
the law, the more definite has become its conviction that it would
ultimately result in destroying that important factor in American
railroad management, "the flexibility of their tariffs&mdash;their adaptability
to the changing commercial and economic conditions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most distinguished and skilled traffic officials in the
country, Mr. Henry Fink, in considering this amendment uses the
following language:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Railroad officials are constantly engaged in the work of adjusting rates
so as to meet as far as practicable the requirement of their patrons. In
times of depression of business they make reduction in rates in order to
enable shippers to send their commodities to certain markets, and keep industrial
establishments from being closed. These reduced rates are often
so low as to barely cover the cost of transportation. But they are meant
to be temporary in their operation, and to be advanced when business conditions
have become more favorable.</p>

<p>"It must be obvious that when the restoration of such rates is obstructed,
so that railroad officials are not permitted to advance rates except by permission
of a government bureau after an investigation which must consume
considerable time, railroad officials will naturally hesitate, and often
decline, to make reductions in rates which involve considerable loss of
revenue without any compensating benefits to their companies, either in
the present or future.</p>

<p>"It is easy to see the effect of this. Railroads would no longer be able
to afford the desired assistance to shippers, however anxious they might be to
do so. The rates would in a large measure lose their elasticity, and become
rigid, and a condition similar to that existing in France would be created,
where state controlled rates prevent railroads from building up the territory."</p></div>

<p>In considering this question, we must not forget that when we
destroy elasticity and flexibility in our rates, we prevent reductions
of rates, as well as the raising of rates. Its tendency is not only to
prevent the reduction in particular instances that has resulted in
great advantage to the shippers and the country in the past, but it
prevents the lowering of the general average of rates. There have
been comparatively few complaints, as to the unreasonableness of
the rates of this country per se. The vast majority of complaints,
against the reasonableness of rates, is the claim that they are relatively
unreasonable. Under the American system of rate adjustment,
with its freedom to meet commercial and economic conditions,
the general average of rates per ton per mile has voluntarily been
reduced by the carriers of the country from 1870; not so strikingly
since 1896 as previously, but substantial reduction as follows:<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>The leaders of railroad management and the ablest experts on
railroad economics in foreign countries have approved in the most
enthusiastic language, the wisdom which has preserved to the American
railway system its freedom of management and its flexibility of
rates, subject only to the limitations of reasonable rates, equality
among shippers, and the avoiding of all devices that might result in
discrimination among those who use these public means of transportation.</p>

<p>The view of M. Emile Heurteau, president of the Orleans Railroad,
speaking of the American system of roads, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We would be only too glad to adopt the American system of fixing the
lowest rates proper, and making up the loss of profit on each shipment
out of the increased volume of business they make the railways available
to, which is the only economically and commercially right and sensible way
of doing. We would be glad to build up our territory as the American
railways do, by encouraging its industries, by opening its markets, by
enabling it to compete with other territory contributing to the same markets.</p>

<p>"But we can not do that; the state-controlled rates prevent it, however
strong our desire or the people's may be.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Railroads under government supervision must set their rates close to
the maxima then, and maintain them there, for their own salvation. There
are many times when, if it were possible, we would like to lower freight
charges to meet some special emergency, such as the necessities of a
district suffering from a crop failure, for example.</p>

<p>"That is not philanthropy, but commercial sense, to help the man who
creates business for you, when he is hard pressed, and to increase the
volume of traffic that is falling because people have not the money to pay
the price they have been accustomed to pay easily. But if we should once
lower our rates&mdash;possibly to the point of loss, as American railways have
done frequently in crises&mdash;we would not be allowed to restore them later,
when they could be fairly restored.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The wonderful growth and development of the United States is the
admiration of the whole world. I have no doubt it is to be attributed largely
to the freedom you have always enjoyed in your commercial and industrial
life.</p>

<p>"Opportunity is given here for railways and communities to be mutually
helpful, and splendid use has been made and is being made of it. The few
cases of complaints against your railways, the expansion of trade through
the opening of European markets to the producers of your Central and
Western States, who are enabled to deliver their products abroad, the
low cost of transportation that enables them to compete there with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
foreign producer near at hand, whose railways are in no position to help
him&mdash;all these things seem to me sufficient evidence of the success and
desirability of the American practice in the management and regulation
of railway matters.</p>

<p>"Any economist, any business man, any transportation manager will tell
you that the present American method of fixing freight rates is the only
logical and rational one."</p></div>

<p>In the investigation of railways by the Senate committee in 1905,
Mr. W. M. Acworth, who is regarded as one of the leading experts
in England on railroad transportation and railroad economics, was
invited to appear before the committee, with the request to give a
review of the historical facts bearing on the control and management
of the railways of England. After complying with the request
of the committee, certain questions were asked him that were of
great importance at that time in the consideration of the questions
then being investigated by the committee. One of these questions
involved the effect of the provision of the new canal and traffic act
of Parliament, which for the first time embodied the provision that
"railway companies must make no increase except for good cause, if
anybody objects," and which, as construed by the courts, prevented
any increase of a rate where objection was made, until after hearing
by the board of trade.</p>

<p>His examination will be found in the third volume of the hearings
of that investigation, pages 1848, 1852, 1853 and 1854, and was as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since it has been decided that no rate can be put up once it has been
put down, without appeal to the law courts, the railway companies have
practically arrived at the conclusion that they will not put them down because
they do not know whether they will have an opportunity to put them
up again.</p>

<p>"Senator <span class="smcap">Cullom</span>: Do you think it works to the advantage of the people
that the railways will not put the rates down for fear they will not get a
chance to put them up again?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Acworth</span>: Personally, I have no doubt it does not. It is fair to
remember always that it may protect the weaker in commercial strife. It is
rather hard on the weaker man to be crowded to the wall by a wholesale
concern in any walk of life. But if it be true in ordinary business that,
on the whole, the public gains by the wholesaling method, it is probably
true in railway business also. I think that, so to speak, the heart has been
taken out of the railway man. The railway men understand this business;
they know how to manage it in their own way. The railway men think
'the responsibility has ceased to be ours; we must maintain the status
quo,' and that is what they do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: You think that dividing responsibility impairs the administrative
power of the officials of the roads as well as the service they
render to the public?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Acworth</span>: From the operating point of view, I do not think our
railways have been sufficiently interfered with to prevent them developing
the goodness of the service. But as to rate making, I have no doubt that
the interference of Parliament, the courts, and the Executive has all tended
to stereotype and keep rates at an unnecessarily high level.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: Would you say that, on the whole, the power to make
rates generally and primarily should be left to the railroads and to the
free play of the forces of the business world?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Acworth</span>: Speaking as an individual student, I have no doubt that
that is the process that will arrive at the best results for the community,
with this exception: That I fully think it is necessary that the community in
some way should interfere to protect all customers from unfair treatment.</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>: You think that the power should reside somewhere to
correct excessive and extortionate rates by summary and proper proceedings?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Acworth</span>: I am not sure that I should go so far as to say excessive
rates regarded as excessive in themselves. I am myself inclined to think
that excessive rates will correct themselves. The wise men will discover
that it does not pay to charge excessive rates. But I think the law should
interfere to prevent unfair rates to A as compared with the rates given to
B. It seems to me that the State is bound to insist that the rates shall be
public, and that practically will settle it, for if they are public they have
got to be fair; I am inclined to think the law should confine itself to securing
that, where there is a difference made as between A and B, the
difference should be a difference for a commercial reason, and not for any
reason of personal favoritism.</p>

<p>"Senator <span class="smcap">Foraker</span>: And I understand you to say that the effect of fixing
maximum rates is to lessen the tendency to reduce rates, which railroads
had practiced before this legislation was enacted?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Acworth</span>: I am not quite sure that the maxima have really had
very much effect at all. It has been a tendency, but I do not think an important
tendency. But the interpretation by the courts of the undue preference
law, and the recent limitation that having once reduced you can not
subsequently increase, have had that effect markedly, I believe.</p>

<p>"Senator <span class="smcap">Foraker</span>: So that the rates for the transportation of freight
on railroads in England have not been declining, I take it from your statement,
in recent years, but have remained practically stationary?</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Acworth</span>: I do not know what the average rate is, because there
are no statistics in England; but my own impression would be that it had
probably not declined to an appreciable extent, whereas in an earlier period
it certainly did decline pretty fast."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of a similar law, passed in England, as shown by the
testimony of Mr. Acworth, confirms the views of the committee
which have been expressed in this report, that with such a provision
embodied in the present interstate commerce law, there would be
few reductions or advances in American rates. If it had the effect
in England of destroying the flexibility of the rates of the carrier
and interfered with the development of England's commerce, as well
as her railroads, how much more serious would be the result in this
country, that is in the process of rapid development, both as to its
commerce and territory? It has been credibly stated that the
Board of Trade of England is now seriously considering a recommendation
for the repeal of that provision of the statute.</p>


<p class="pfs80">AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNICATION TO THE COMMISSION&mdash;MANY
OF ITS OBJECTIONS APPLY TO THE AMENDMENT OFFERED IN

<p>9. &nbsp; When this bill was referred to your committee for its consideration
the chairman addressed a letter to the Interstate Commerce
Commission, inclosing the bill, and requested the opinion of the commission
as to the wisdom of incorporating the amendment into the

majority of the commissioners and probably all of them would not be disposed
to favor the enactment of this measure.</p>

<p>"To give to the protest of a single shipper the effect of preventing the
advance of any rate until the reasonableness of that advance was affirmatively
determined by the commission would establish a hard and fast rule
of doubtful fairness to the railroads and questionable advantage to the
public. Under existing conditions we are of the opinion that it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
unwise to adopt the arbitrary limitation which this bill proposes, whatever
may be found desirable or necessary in this regard in the future.</p>

<p>"It is further to be observed that the passage of such a bill at this time
would impose a burden upon the commission which it ought not to be asked
to undertake. If every proposed advance had to be investigated by the
commission and officially sanctioned before it could take effect, the number
of cases to be considered would presumably be so great as to render their
prompt disposition almost impossible. In instances of justifiable increase
the necessary delay resulting from the probable volume of cases would
work injustice to the carriers. Until conditions become more stable and
the substantive provisions of the act are more completely observed in railway
tariffs and practices we entertain the belief that a wider latitude of discretion
on the part of carriers than this measure allows should be permitted.</p>

<p>"It is also suggested that the practical effect of the proposed amendment
might be to prevent voluntary reductions of rates by the carriers. If no
rate could be increased without the approval of the commission after affirmative
showing by the carrier it might happen that many reductions now
voluntarily accorded would not be made.</p>

<p>"This subject of rate advances was discussed in our recent annual report
to the Congress, and that portion of the report is transmitted herewith for
the information of your committee. It concludes with a recommendation
relating to the matter in question in which the entire commission concurred,
and that recommendation is now respectfully renewed.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p class="pad6">"Very respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">"<em>Chairman</em>."</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>It will be observed by an examination of this communication from
the commission that it deemed it unwise to recommend the adoption
of the amendment to the sixth section as offered in Senate bill 423,
but the letter refers to its former report as expressive of its views
upon this subject, which recommended a somewhat similar provision,
but differing in this respect. In Senate bill 423 the filing of a
protest would suspend the taking effect of the rate until after full
hearing as to the merits of the advance. The recommendation of
the commission in its former report, referred to in the communication,
recommended the adoption of a provision that would confer
upon the commission, upon the filing of a complaint, the discretion
to suspend the rate until final hearing. The amendment to the bill
before your committee offered during its consideration, and which
has been fully discussed in this report, was in substance the recommendation
of the commission.</p>

<p>An analysis of the letter of the chairman of the commission, stating
the objections to the enactments of the proposed amendment into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
law, sustains many of the reasons which have been urged in this
report against the approval of the principle announced by that
amendment. The committee quotes from the letter, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"(a) To give to the protest of a single shipper the effect of preventing the
advance of any rate until the reasonableness of that advance was affirmatively
determined by the commission, would establish a hard and fast rule of
doubtful fairness to the railroads and questionable advantage to the public.</p>

<p>"(b) Under existing conditions we are of the opinion that it would be
unwise to adopt the arbitrary limitation which this bill proposes.</p>

<p>"(c) If every proposed advance had to be investigated by the commission
and officially sanctioned before it could take effect the number of cases to be
considered would presumably be so great as to render this prompt disposition
almost impossible.</p>

<p>"(d) It is further to be observed that the passage of such a bill at this
time would impose a burden upon the commission, which it should not be
asked to undertake.</p>

<p>"(e) In instances of justifiable increase all necessary delay resulting from
probable volume of cases would work injustice to the carriers.</p>

<p>"(f) Until conditions become more stable and the substantive operations
of the act are more completely observed in railway tariffs and practices,
we entertain the belief that a wider latitude of discretion on the part of
carriers than this measure allows would be permitted.</p>

<p>"(g) It is also suggested that the practical effect of a proposed amendment
might be to prevent voluntary reductions of rates by the carriers.</p>

<p>"(h) If no rate could be increased without the approval of the commission
after affirmative showing by the carrier, it might happen that many
reductions now voluntarily accorded would not be made."</p></div>

<p>The nine reasons suggested by the commission why the original
amendment offered to section 6 should not be adopted, fully sustain
the committee in reporting the bill adversely, and to a great extent,
fully justify the views which it has expressed in this report as influencing
the actions of the committee in its adverse report upon the
amendment proposed in the committee.</p>

<p>The committee is unable to appreciate the force of the suggestion
of the modification proposed to the original amendment, as in any
way changing the principle embodied in it, or the practical results
which would flow from its adoption. If the power was conferred
upon the commission, when a rate was advanced, upon complaint to
suspend the going into effect of that rate until a final hearing, every
objection urged by the commission to the adoption of the bill, but
the first two, would be applicable to the modification proposed by
the commission to the original amendment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the modification suggested by the commission the burden
imposed upon it would be greater, if possible, than under the original
amendment. Under the original amendment, by force of the
statute, the filing of the protest would suspend the advanced rate,
and the hearing upon the merits would take place after the thirty
days had expired. Under the suggestion of the commission conferring
upon it the discretionary authority upon complaint to determine
whether the rate should go into effect at the time prescribed by
law or be suspended, there is imposed an official quasi judicial duty
upon the commission, which it should not perform except upon proof
that probably the rate sought to be advanced would ultimately be
determined to be unreasonable. Remembering the large number of
changes of rates daily, and the fact that under the law the complaint
could be filed at any time within the thirty days, would it not be an
impossible undertaking for the commission to hope to perform this
official act with justice to the public or to the carrier? In the multiplicity
of duties now demanding its most earnest attention, would
not the practical operation of such a law compel it to enter a pro
forma order of suspension until the final hearing, when the commission,
upon an examination of the complaint, is satisfied that it presented
a prima facie case of unreasonable advance?</p>

<p>An official tribunal charged with the duty of preventing an unreasonable
advance in rates would be constrained, on the presentation
of such a complaint, to issue the order of suspension. If the
slightest doubt was raised in its mind as to the reasonableness of
the advance, its official obligation would require it to enter the order
of suspension. Is there any question that such a prima facie case
could be made where the consideration of the protest would, of
necessity, be ex parte?</p>

<p>The committee is not, therefore, able to draw a distinction between
the original amendment and that proposed in committee. In the
opinion of the committee the reasons stated in the letter of the chairman
of the commission, and the reasons given in this report, not only
justify it but compel an adverse report.</p>


<p class="pfs80">CONDITIONS CONFRONTING CONGRESS.</p>

<p>10. &nbsp; The act of June 29, 1906, took effect August 28, 1906. It
has been operative only about twenty-eight months. During half of
that period of time the country has experienced the effects of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
severe commercial panic; business has been prostrated; transportation
paralyzed; thousands of cars have been stored on the sidings,
and hundreds of engines have been placed in the shops, awaiting the
revival of business. From conditions existing today, we have a
right to assume that before many months we shall be approaching
normal conditions. The commission has not had sufficient time to
interpret and construe the recent law and to promulgate its orders
in reference to the action of the carriers under it. Many of the
traffic questions involved, under the provisions of that law, are yet
to be construed and put in force by orders of the commission. Is
it wise, under these conditions, to begin amending that statute by
introducing provisions inconsistent with the basis of the act? It
has been shown that under the power conferred by that recent
enactment, the commission is vested with the power to change an
existing unreasonable rate and to fix for the future a reasonable rate.
It has also the authority conferred upon it to award reparation to
the extent of any injury resulting to a shipper, by reason of the
existence of an unreasonable rate.</p>

<p>Attention has been called to the opinion of the commission, as
expressed in its decisions, narrowing very greatly the right of the
carrier to advance a rate that would meet with its approval upon
hearing. The committee must assume, in considering this question,
that both the shippers and traffic officials, with knowledge of the
views entertained by the commission upon the question of an advance
of rates, will in the one case be prompt to avail themselves
of that attitude of the commission, and in the other that they will
seek to so adjust their rates as to bring their schedules within the
rulings of that tribunal. The committee believes the highest duty of
the commission is to bring together shippers and carriers, to the
end that each may see that neither can be permanently prosperous at
the expense of the other. It further believes that in many instances
this effort has been made by the commission, and successfully made.
It cannot be accomplished by statutes causing rigidity of rates. The
most sensitive spot in the great business dealings of the country is
the railroad rate. This rate must be raised or lowered, not in obedience
to a rigid statutory law, but in obedience to the varying conditions
of trade and commerce.</p>

<p>The National Board of Trade, one of the most important commercial
organizations in the country and one of the most influential,
met in Washington on Tuesday, January 19, 1909. Two proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
resolutions were submitted to that convention. First, by the Philadelphia
Press League, urging an amendment to the interstate commerce
law, to permit railroads engaged in interstate traffic to enter
into the making of agreements under the supervision and control of
the Interstate Commerce Commission. The second proposition was
submitted by the Scranton Board of Trade, embodying the provisions
of the amendment offered in the committee upon the consideration
of Senate bill 423, and approved in the report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission as to the advance of rates.</p>

<p>These resolutions were referred to the committee on resolutions
having charge of interstate commerce matters. That committee,
through its chairman, made the following report, which was unanimously
indorsed by the convention of the National Board of Trade:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The committee on interstate commerce law respectfully reports that, in
its judgment, the National Board of Trade ought not at this time to recommend
any change in the laws relating to interstate commerce."</p></div>

<p>The convention was not satisfied with the passage of this resolution,
but the chairmen of the several committees of that association
were subsequently authorized and directed by resolution to urge the
conclusions of the board in its name whenever possible.</p>

<p>The country is now demanding repose in its industrial upbuilding.
It is not a time to experiment and to change the basis upon
which the former acts to regulate commerce have been predicated.
The recent law passed by Congress so greatly enlarging the authority
of the commission should, before changes are sought, have the
opportunity of at least a fair trial as to the value of its provisions
in the regulation of interstate commerce. When trial has been
given and normal conditions have been restored, any defect in the
regulating statute can then, in the light of experience, be promptly
remedied.</p>

<p>The mileage is the same as above, with the added information
that the mileage operated at the end of the fiscal year 1908 was
229,952.36; and at the end of 1909, 234,182.70.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that the taxes in both summaries are identical,
but in one they are subtracted from net revenues and in the other
they are not.</p>

<p>An insert facing page 54, giving the details of the monthly
reports from which the table on that page is compiled, reveals the
common source of both sets of returns and gives the key to the
discrepancy between them. This is no less than the inclusion in
the former of the revenues and expenses from "outside operations,"
which are excluded from the summary on page 54, in which the
"net revenue" only from such outside source is mentioned and
added to the net revenue from rail operations.</p>

<p>The impropriety and inaccuracy of such accounting becomes
manifest when its effect is seen to vary the ratio of operating expenses
to earnings from 69.67% to 69.93% in 1908, and from 66.12% to
66.64% in 1909.</p>

<p>On pages 64 and 65 appears another set of income figures for the
year ending June 30, 1908. This is compiled from the annual
reports of the carriers operating 230,494 miles of line, from which
<em>the mileage of switching and terminal companies is excluded</em>. It
supplies the following summary:</p>

<p>As these figures are compiled from the only returns which furnish
data respecting all the various phases of railway operation in the
United States, they will be accepted in subsequent pages as the
official returns for 1908.</p>

<p>The above figures are exclusive of returns from switching and
terminal companies, whose earnings, according to the monthly
reports in 1908, were $23,028,773; expenses, $16,383,481, and
taxes, $1,245,261.</p>


<p class="pfs100 smcap">Grossly Exaggerated Dividends.</p>

<p>But these are venial variations compared to the deliberate
misrepresentation as to dividends on page 62 of the report, where
it is stated:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"The amount of dividends declared during the year was
$386,879,362, being equivalent to 7.99 per cent on dividend-paying
stock. For the year ending June 30, 1907, the amount of dividends
declared was $308,088,627."</p>

<p>This statement is the more reprehensible because the inaccuracy
of the reference to dividends in 1907 was exposed a year ago, and
$115,550,909 of the 1908 total is proved to be fictitious by the line
in the condensed income statement of the report (page 65) reading:
"Dividends declared from current income, $271,388,453." It takes
dividends from surplus, dividends by leased companies, and dividends
from surplus of leased companies to make up that gross deception
as to the dividends declared in 1908. And all these "several dividends"
are only made statistically possible by including in current
income $274,450,192 "other income" NOT derived from transportation.</p>

<p>It is impossible to overestimate the harmful popular effect of
exaggerating the dividends paid by the railways by $80,693,665 in
1907 and $115,550,909 in 1908. The public mind does not stop to
distinguish between dividends "declared," dividends paid out of
"income" and net dividends actually paid out of net earnings of
railway traffic.</p>

<p>This whole statistical structure of fictitious dividends has been
built up in successive reports upon the false premise of including
intercorporate payments on both sides of the income account.
What the public is entitled to know is the disposition of the gross
sum paid by it for transportation services&mdash;those services which
the Act to Regulate Commerce was passed to regulate.</p>


<p class="pfs100 smcap">Bewildering Changes in Nomenclature.</p>

<p>Scattered through the official reports for 1908 the student is
confronted with numerous changes in terminology, many of which
are for the better, but nearly all impair that continuity of names
and phrases which is so desirable in comparative statistics. For
instance, the public has been taught, by official practice, to speak
of the revenues of the railways derived from the transportation of
passengers, freight, mail and express, as "Gross earnings from
operation." The phrase is descriptive, definite and clear. For
this the Commission has substituted "Rail operations, operating
revenues." Former reports spoke of "Income from operation,"
which now gives place to "Net operating revenue." To this is
added the "net revenue from outside operations," making a "Total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
net revenue," from which "Taxes accrued" are deducted, the
remainder being "Operating income."</p>

<p>It will be perceived that this last phrase, which covers revenues
from which operating expenses and taxes have been deducted and
to which the net revenues from outside operations (sometimes they
involve a deficit) have been added, comes perilously near the
"Income from operation" of preceding reports.</p>

<p>The exclusion of the reports from switching and terminal companies
in some instances, while they are included in others, introduces
an element of perplexing uncertainty at every turn and really
vitiates all comparisons with former reports.</p>

<p>The Commission itself seems to realize the bog into which the
official statistician has plunged its accounts, when it says:</p>

<p>"The changes in the income account submitted in the report
under consideration <em>are so far reaching in their results</em>, in a number
of instances, as to impair direct or close comparison with figures for
similar items in previous statistical reports."</p>

<p>And now it is proposed to throw all the accumulated statistics
of twenty-two years out of consecutive gear by substituting the
calendar for the fiscal year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The writer has deemed the foregoing comments necessary to
clear the atmosphere before proceeding to the introductory summary
showing the salient features of the railway industry in 1909 compared
with similar items in 1899 and 1889. The data for 1909 is compiled
from the annual reports to this Bureau covering 221,132 miles of
operated line, together with the monthly reports to the Commission
of earnings and expenses of all classes of roads for that year, covering
an average operated mileage of 233,002.</p>

<p>There is not a line or figure of this table, with its percentages
of increase, that does not testify at once to the amazing growth of
American railways and to the equally amazing economical basis
upon which they render incalculable services to the American people
on terms that challenge the admiration of less favored peoples.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Review of the Last Three Calendar Years.</span></p>

<p>Where the Twenty-second Annual Report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission minimized the loss inflicted on the railways
by the business depression of 1908, the Twenty-third Annual Report
naturally, and by reason of the same cause, minimizes the substantial
recovery of 1909. Where the former showed a loss in gross
earnings of only $164,464,941 below the preceding year, when the
actual result of the depression was nearly $300,000,000 ($298,457,576),
the latter shows a recovery of only $21,770,228, when it was approximately
$282,000,000 ($281,934,932).</p>

<p>The explanation of this discrepancy is, of course, the Commission's
adherence to its own fiscal periods of statistics, which do
not happen, in this instance, to coincide with the ebb and flow of
adversity and prosperity. The true movement of railway traffic
before, during and after the recent business depression is more
nearly reflected in the following figures for the calendar years 1907,
1908 and 1909, compiled from the monthly returns to the Interstate
Commerce Commission, divided into periods of six months:</p>

<p>Through these tables the reader is able to trace the upward
course of railway receipts in 1907 to their culmination in October
of that year; their rapid drop to February, 1908; through the hard
summer following to the gradual recovery of 1909, until in October
last they reached the highest monthly total on record.</p>

<p>Concurrently with this story of the depression of 1908, the tale
of railway distress and of the drastic measures adopted to meet the
emergency can be read in the half-yearly ratios. The ratio for the
fiscal year 1906-'07 was 67.53%, and the shadow of approaching
trouble was shown in an increase of this ratio to 67.7% for the first
six months in the table. By December this ratio had risen to
73.40%. The enormous receipts of the autumn months held the
ratio for the six months down to 68%. In February, 1908, it
marked the high and ruinous figure of 76.84, and from that point
the trend, due to severe retrenchments, was steadily downward
until it touched 60.10% in October, 1909.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The ratio of 64.1% for the second half of 1908 is the true measure
of the ability of the railways to cut their expenditures to fit the
times. But they were on bed rock, as the succeeding months of
small receipts proved, when the ratio went up to 72.43% in January,
and averaged the high figure of 68.3% for the first six months of
1909. The heavy receipts of October and November without a
corresponding expansion of expenditures resulted in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'phenomenonally'">phenomenally</ins>
low ratios of these months. But the severity and necessities
of operating conditions in December, 1909, ran the ratio of
expenses up to 69.23%.</p>

<p>The net earnings for the three years under consideration are
apt to lead to erroneous conclusions as to the effect of the depression.
Neither the loss in 1908 nor the recovery in 1909 reflects the
true swing of the pendulum. The one minimizes the loss, because
it conceals the cessation of all constructive work, the curtailment of
betterments and improvements, and the postponement of all purchases
for replacements except of the most immediate and imperative
nature; the other exaggerates the recovery because of heavy receipts
without the resumption of the concurrent expenditures that
should attend them. The railways in the fall of 1909 were simply
doing business on the margin of facilities provided during the fat
months of 1907 in anticipation of a continuation of prosperous times.
Some idea of the extent of this margin may be gained from the parking
of 400,000 freight cars in the yards with 200,000 in the shops
in April, 1908. At no time since has this margin been wholly
exhausted.</p>

<p>But a continuation of traffic on the scale of the past six months
will necessitate an immediate expenditure of $100,000,000 to $150,000,000
for the replacement of freight cars alone.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that while the earnings in 1909 exceeded
those of 1907 by over 15½ millions they were almost $300 less per
mile, while the operating expenses were actually $442 less per mile.
The decreased operating ratio in 1909 bears unmistakable testimony
as to where the increase in net revenues came from.</p>

<p>With an increase of nearly 9,000 miles of line only $339,167,665
was spent on maintenance of way and structures in 1909 against
$343,544,907 in 1907, and the urgent demands of returning activity
made the expenditures on this account liberal in comparison with
those for the year ending June 30, 1909, i. e. $311,368,083, or $1,336
per mile. It will be years before the railways recover from the
economies forced on them by the loss of $300,000,000 in revenues
in 1908.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Unregulated Regulation of American Railways.</span></p>

<p>Today the railways of the United States are "cribb'd, cabin'd
and confined" in their services to the American people, not so much
by the laws for their regulation as by the spirit in which those laws
are administered. To the general tenor and purposes of statutory
regulation the railways have become largely reconciled; but from
the spirit in which the laws are sought to be enforced, there has to
be continuous appeal to the courts and to the public sense of justice.</p>

<p>Regulation of railways has been persistently interpreted by
political Commissions to spell reduction of rates and exacting conditions
that would drain the purse of Fortunatus. Between 1889,
when the Interstate Commerce Commission's statistics first became
a valuable index of railway operation, and 1909, the average rate
per ton mile has fallen from 9.22 to 7.55 mills. On the freight
tonnage of 1909 this meant a reduction of over $372,000,000 in the
yearly revenues of the railways. The railways suffered that loss
from their income when they needed every cent of it to maintain
the people's highway in a condition to transport the people's ever-growing
traffic.</p>

<p>The railways lost it, but who got it? The people? Search the
market reports of the land, from Eastport to San Diego, and you
will find incontestable proof that not one cent of these millions
reached the pockets of the people, in whose name all regulation of
railways is demanded and for whose benefit all reductions are claimed.
The average rate on all commodities has gone down, the price of
every commodity transported by the railways has gone up. Who
has pocketed the difference?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be only one answer&mdash;the producers, the shippers and
the traders. Today nine-tenths of the increased cost of living in
the United States is chargeable to this ever vigilant and aggressive
coalition. For everything the railways must buy&mdash;labor, supplies,
money&mdash;they have to pay the advanced prices of the day. But
the protests of the shippers and the rulings of the Commission forbid
their raising a rate or adopting a money-saving economy. They
attempted to readjust freight rates in 1900 one-fiftieth of a cent per
ton mile above a ruinously low average and the outraged shippers
secured the passage of the Hepburn Act!</p>

<p>How the federal Commission and shippers work together for the
so-called regulation of the railways is evidenced in the unbroken
tenor of the decisions handed down by the Commission. Out of
357 decisions printed during the year 1908-09, no less than 219, or
61.3%, were orders granting reductions of rates or reparation for
charges found comparatively excessive or unreasonable. In not one
case in a score was the rate found excessive or unreasonable per se.
In only one case out of the 357 was an increased rate ordered, and
this was done reluctantly and as unavoidable.</p>

<p>Although the decisions are for the most part the unanimous
finding of the Commission, the following table distributes the opinions
of the year among its members into dismissals and reductions or
reparations among the Commissioners writing them:</p>

<p>Some of the cases upon which the Commission is called on to pass
are so trivial as to be beneath the notice of a justice's court, while
others involve issues so momentous as to threaten the whole structure
of railway rates by which the unparalleled prosperity of the country
has been made possible.</p>

<p>But the number of cases reaching the Commission for adjudication
is insignificant compared with the grist of informal reparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
orders that runs an endless stream through its regulating rollers.
In the twelve months from December 1, 1908, to November 30, 1909,
these aggregated no less than 2,223 separate orders involving amounts
all the way from 47 cents to $14,717.64, as seen in the following
orders:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>7100. <em>Larabee Flour Mills Company</em> v. <em>Atchison, Topeka &amp;
Santa Fe Railway Company</em>. September 11, 1909. Refund of
$0.47 on shipment of cotton bags from Kansas City, Mo., to
Hutchinson, Kas., on account of excessive rate.</p>

<p>3629. <em>Lackawanna Steel Company</em> v. <em>Central Railroad Company
of New Jersey</em>. June 26, 1909. Refund of $14,717.64 on
shipments of spiegeleisen from Newark, N. J., and Hazard, Pa.,
to Buffalo, N. Y., on account of excessive rates.</p></div>

<p>Multiplying these awards by the number of orders enables the
reader to imagine the range of their respective pettiness or portentous
possibilities.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if the American people, or even the Interstate
Commerce Commissioners themselves, realize how the formal decisions
and informal orders of the Commission are slowly but surely
whittling away the safe margin of American railway profits. At the
rate of two decisions every three days and forty informal orders per
week, the work of incipient confiscation proceeds with remorseless
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>With the best intentions in the world the present Interstate
Commerce Commission is so enmeshed in its own anti-railway traditions,
so enamored of the administrative control theories of its
statistician, so covetous of unbridled, irresponsible authority to
tear down where it has no constructive capacity, that anything like
co-operation between the Commission and the railway management
for the public good seems out of the question.</p>

<p>To the writer it appears that only blind rejection of facts can
find any conserving element in the regulation of railways as at
present administered. Signs of a helpful disposition in official acts
are entirely lacking. The Senate and House calendars groan under
bills for the further regulation and restriction of the railways, but
not one contains a promise of relief. For not one is there a genuine
public demand.</p>

<p>And what is the situation as this is written? It can be stated
in a few lines. As a consequence of the drop of $300,000,000 in
gross earnings in 1908, the railways in 1908 and 1909 cut $277,000,000
out of their expenditures. This was done mainly at the expense
of maintenance of way and structures and in a cessation in the purchase
of equipment, but the so-called economies of postponed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
expenditures permeated every line of railway extension, operation
and replacement. In 1908, with 6,000 more miles of track to maintain,
$18,788,217 less was spent for maintenance than in 1907, and
in 1909 with 12,000 more miles of track $32,176,824 less was expended.</p>

<p>Between 1897 and 1907 the expenditures for maintenance of
way increased from $159,434,403 to $343,544,907, or over 115%.
This means an increase of approximately 8% a year, or at least
$25,000,000 on present plant. Therefore at least $43,000,000 was
withheld from this essential line of railway maintenance in 1908
and fully $82,000,000 in 1909, a total of $125,000,000. The saving
on equipment was nearly as great and is dealt with in the body of
the report.</p>

<p>A comparison of the income accounts for the month of October,
1907 and 1908, corroborates the foregoing statement as to the
economies forced on the railways by the adverse winds of regulation
and business depression.</p>

<p>The canker worm in this, the most promising flower of returning
prosperity, is revealed in the abnormal ratio of 60.10 for October,
1909, or nearly 7% below the American average. Now this 7% on
the revenues of last October means that in some way over $16,000,000
less than normal was expended on American railways in that month
alone. And October, 1909, was only a sample of how railways had
cut expenses for 24 consecutive months.</p>

<p>That this should be so, with no reduction in the scale of wages
or the price of supplies, is, in the view of the writer, a situation of
serious national concern. Happily he is not charged with any
commission to suggest how or where the deferred debt of nearly
$300,000,000 to efficient railway road and equipment is to be met.
But that it must be met, to place the railways in as good condition
as they were before the panic of 1907, when the cry was for more,
not less facilities, does not admit of question. If it, together with
the advance in wages now being adjusted, is to be met out of income,
only an advance in freight rates can take care of it. If out of fresh
capital, it can only be coaxed from the pockets of shrewd investors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
by rates of interest that discount the risk attendant on the unregulated
and irresponsible regulation of railway revenues, resources
and responsibilities. And it is proposed to make an irresponsible
Commission, unfamiliar with the necessities of the situation and
unversed in the ways and means of raising capital arbiters of these
necessities, ways and means.</p>

<p>All attempts to meet such a situation by legislation, unless it
be directed to a reform of the instrumentalities of regulation, must
prove ineffectual. In a broader, saner, more helpful administration
of the laws already on the federal and state statute books lies the
hope for the future of the great American transportation industry.
"Whate'er is best administered is best."</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">The Bureau's Statistics for 1909.</span></p>

<p>Thus far what has been written has related almost wholly to the
financial aspect of the transportation industry as presented through
the monthly reports of the railways. While these in their way serve
as an admirable barometer in keeping the public informed as to
general business conditions throughout the Union, they throw
little light upon the railway operations behind the financial results.
They are absolutely dumb on the main question upon which all
railway legislation and regulation should hinge&mdash;adequate and
efficient public service.</p>

<p>In the following pages the Bureau attempts to remedy this
omission, in the essential particulars for the year ending June 30,
1909. The reports from which its summaries have been compiled
were received almost a month earlier this year than last, but the
publication of the Bureau's statistics has been delayed in order to
make the usual comparisons with the Official Statistics for 1908.
The writer is advised from Washington that the fault for this unusual
delay rests with the Government printer&mdash;whose office is
overwhelmed with Congressional and departmental work&mdash;and not
with the Interstate Commerce Commission or its Bureau of Statistics
and Accounts.</p>

<p>For the first time, the reports to this Bureau cover the division
of freight movement into the seven chief commodities; the separation
of revenues from Mail and Express; the distribution of expenses for
injuries and damages, and the summaries of expenses for maintenance
of way and equipment, traffic expenses, transportation expenses
and general expenses. It is believed that with the addition of these
accounts the annual report of the Bureau has become so compre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>hensive
as to warrant its publication hereafter at an earlier date,
without waiting on the publication of the official statistics for the
preceding year.</p>

<p>This year the Bureau has received reports from 368 roads operating
221,132 miles of line or approximately 94.4% of the mileage and
carrying over 97% of the traffic of the country. Last year reports
were received covering 216,460 miles. The increase of 4,672 miles
fairly represents the actual increase of railway mileage in the United
States for the twelve months.</p>

<p>In presenting these statistics, the writer has endeavored to make
them as colorless summaries of facts as an earnest desire to arrive
at the truth permits. Such comment as accompanies them will
be confined to comparisons and elucidation and not to the furtherance
of any personal theories.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity, the Interstate Commerce Commission
will be referred to herein as the "Commission"; the Commission's
"Statistics of Railways in the United States" as "Official Statistics"
and "the year ending June 30th" will be implied before
the year named unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>The statements as to foreign railways are compiled from the
latest official sources available.</p>

<p>Here the writer wishes to record his personal appreciation of the
assistance rendered by the executives and accounting officials of
the railways, whose co-operation has made this report possible. In
the midst of increasing burdens imposed on them in reporting to
federal and state commissions and legislatures, the requests for
information from this Bureau might have seemed excusably negligible.
The completeness of the report itself testifies to the cordiality
with which the Bureau's work is viewed.</p>

<p>Acknowledgments are also due to Federal and State officials
for their uniform courtesy in responding to the many requests from
this Bureau, and the writer has been much gratified to receive from
the chief government railway official of one foreign country the
assurance that he considers its Annual Report "one of the most
comprehensive and useful compilations of statistical matter relating
to railways that has come into his hands."</p>

<p>The returns to this Bureau, compiled from the annual reports
for the same year, cover 221,132 miles, against 216,460 in 1908, an
increase of 4,672 miles. Reports to the Commission for December,
1909, showed a total operated mileage of 236,166 miles.</p>

<p>In its report dated December 21, 1909, the Commission stated
that for the year ending June 30, 1908, substantially complete returns
had been received for 230,494 miles of line operated, including
8,661.34 miles used under trackage rights. These are the official
figures of mileage for 1908, which will be used in all subsequent
comparisons with the Bureau's figures for 1909&mdash;the latter, however,
may include some switching and terminal mileage excluded from the
former.</p>

<p>Of the mileage reporting to this Bureau, 8,927 miles were operated
under trackage rights, leaving a net of 212,205 miles of line covered
by capitalization and rental.</p>

<p>Assuming that the total operated mileage in the United States
at the close of the fiscal year 1909 was 234,182, the complete returns
to this Bureau cover approximately 94.4% of the mileage and 97%
of the traffic of all the railways in the United States. No attempt
has been made, or will be made, to segregate the returns of switching
and terminal companies from the Bureau's figures, of which they
are an integral part.</p>

<p>The first summary under this table presents the <em>operated</em> mileage
reported to this Bureau in 1909 and 1908, classified by states and
territories in comparison with the official figures of mileage owned

<p>The column of operated mileage in 1909 testifies to the comprehensive
character of the reports to this Bureau, while the last two
columns demonstrate how railway extension has kept pace with the
growth of the country. Territorially the United States now has
43% more railway mileage than it had in 1890, and the last column
proves that the mileage is greater proportionately to the population
than it was twenty years ago. The contrast in the density of population
per mile of line between Rhode Island and Nevada is illustrative
of the startling diversity of conditions under which railways are
operated in the United States.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Railways Built in 1909.</span></p>

<p>The new mileage reported as constructed in 1909 tallies more
nearly than usual with the increase in mileage for which operating
reports are received. As reported in the <cite>Railway and Engineering
Review</cite>, February 19, 1910, the new mileage by states was as follows:</p>

<p>Of the above total railway mileage for the whole world, no less
than 332,360 miles, or nearly 56%, is operated in English speaking
countries, the mileage of the United States alone being over 35% of
the whole.</p>

<p>To the most casual student the disparity between the density
of population to railway mileage in the United States and Europe of
one to five, is as apparent as it is significant of our necessity for so
much greater provision of transportation facilities per capita. If
our per capita mileage were relatively the same as that of Europe,
the United States would be set back to the transportation facilities
of 1869, when the completion of the Union Pacific raised its total
mileage to 47,254 miles. But even then it had a ratio of one mile
of railway to 810 inhabitants, which was higher than Europe's ratio

<p>Clearly there is nothing in the statistics of the railway mileage
of the world to account for the epidemic of railway phobia
that periodically convulses the people and legislatures of the United
States of America.</p>

<p>Of almost equal importance to the mileage of American railways
are the auxiliary tracks upon which the extent and efficiency of their
public service so largely depends. As the next statement shows,
these continue to increase more rapidly than the miles of line.</p>

<p>By adding the auxiliary trackage reported to this Bureau for
1909 to the 234,182 miles of operated line reported to the Interstate
Commerce Commission for June 30 of that year, it appears that the
total of all tracks on that date was <em>upwards of 340,000 miles</em>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in every instance the mileage of second,
third and fourth track and yard track and sidings reported to this
Bureau in 1909, the year of comparative stagnation in railway
construction, exceeded the complete mileage of these tracks in 1908
reported to the Commission.</p>

<p>The above table (with the Commission's figures for single track)
shows that where there has been an increase of only 50,798 miles
of single track, or 27.7%, in twelve years, all trackage has increased
over 98,000, or 42%, during the same period. It also shows that
during the same twelve years second track has increased 87%; third
track 120%; fourth track 91%, and yard track and sidings 76%.</p>

<p>Here it will be perceived the mileage of British roads increased
only 608 miles and the trackage only 2,035 miles in four years.
During the same period, as shown in the preceding table, the mileage
of American railways increased 18,251 miles and their total trackage
36,543. It is this continuous demand for increased mileage and
trackage in the United States, to say nothing of equipment, that
differentiates the problem confronting American railway management
from British. In the United States we need more railways and
still more railways, and the problem is to get the capital on reasonable
terms to provide the facilities.</p>

<p>In railroad mileage alone we have over ten times that of the
United Kingdom and we have more than six times as many miles
of track. We have enough trackage in our yards and sidings to
double track all the British railways, with enough over to put four
tracks where they have only two tracks now.</p>

<p>No car shortage occurred to interrupt the orderly movement of
railway traffic during the fiscal year 1908-09. On the contrary,
there was an unprofitable surplus of cars throughout the year,
ranging from 110,912 in September, 1908, to 333,019 in January,
1909. From this high figure the surplus was slowly reduced by the
demands of traffic until subsequent to the close of the fiscal year,
in September last, it reached a practical level of shortages and
surpluses. During the year there was an average of 150,000 freight
cars in the shops, where in times of ordinary activity the mean
would be in the neighborhood of 100,000.</p>

<p>These conditions, which prevailed since November, 1907, account
for the greatly reduced purchases of rolling stock during the years
1908 and 1909 shown in the following record of locomotives and cars
built in the United States during the past eleven years:</p>

<p>Between 1898 and 1908 the Interstate Commerce Commission
reported an increase of 21,464 locomotives, 11,697 passenger cars, and
856,999 freight and company cars. Allowing for the Canadian output
in the above table, this would show 22,742 more locomotives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
13,821 more passenger cars, and 674,023 more freight cars built in
ten years than are accounted for in the official returns. Roughly
speaking, these last figures represent the number of locomotives and
cars worn out beyond repair or destroyed that have to be replaced
annually. It means that provision has to be made every year for
the purchase of new equipment amounting to approximately 5% of
locomotives and passenger cars and 4% of freight cars in order to
maintain the equipment numerically, irrespective of the sums spent
on maintaining the remainder in serviceable condition.</p>

<p>It is probable that the computed percentage for the replacement
of locomotives and passenger cars is too high and that for freight
cars too low. This is the opinion of operating officials. If so,
it would amount to a set off and the aggregate would still be approximately
$142,000,000 to be expended annually for new equipment
to take the place of old, worn out and discarded rolling stock.
Conditions forbade the expenditure of any such sum in 1908 and 1909.</p>

<p>Complete returns will raise the totals for 1909 approximately to
57,704 locomotives of 1,465,070,000 pounds tractive power and 4,158,000
tons weight, exclusive of tenders. These figures bear out the
conclusion expressed above that the purchase of new locomotives in
1909 was barely sufficient to replace those abandoned or destroyed
during the year. The loss, however, was in a measure made good
by the greater weight of the new engines. As the average weight of
locomotives in 1899 was approximately 53 tons, the figures just
given indicate an increase of nearly 114% in the weight of all locomotives
during the decade.</p>

<p>In connection with the estimate of $15,000 put on locomotives
in this report, it is of interest to reproduce the return to the legislature
of New South Wales of the cost of engines built in the railway
shops at Sydney recently. The figures refer to 6-wheel-coupled
heavy mail and express engines weighing, with tender, 163,128
pounds, as published in the <cite>Railway Age-Gazette</cite>, December 3, 1909:</p>

<p>Applied to a Mallet articulated compound locomotive, such as
that built for the Erie weighing 410,000 pounds on the drivers, the
rate per ton paid by the government of New South Wales would
make it cost over $60,000. It did not cost any such sum, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>

<p>It is in the increased capacity of locomotives and cars rather
than in their numbers that the seeker after truth will find the
explanation of how American railways have been able to handle
freight traffic that has increased in volume over 80% in ten years
where numerically the increase of equipment has been less than
60%. During that period the average capacity of the freight car
has increased from 27 to nearly 35 tons, accounting for an aggregate
increase of 109.6%.</p>

<p>Between 1899 and 1909 the population of the United States
increased from 74,318,000 to 88,806,000, or 19.5%. (On April 1,
1910, the treasury estimate was an even 90,000,000.) In the same
ten years the number of passenger cars increased over 36%, accompanied
by a steady advance in their size, strength and conveniences.</p>

information showing the gradual transformation taking place in
the number and capacity of freight cars:</p>

<p>The line of cleavage between former and modern railway methods
of handling freight is clearly shown in the above table to lie between
cars of 25 and 30 ton capacity. The former and all of less capacity
are on the decline, whereas the latter and all of greater capacity
are on the increase. Numerically the 30-ton cars still exceed those
of 40 and 50 tons, but already they are exceeded by the combined
capacity of the latter.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">The Surplus of Freight Cars.</span></p>

<p>For two years (28 months as this is written) the reports of the
Committee on Car Efficiency of the American Railway Association
show that the supply of freight cars has been in excess of the demand.
In other words, the railways during that period were paying interest
on a considerable percentage of unremunerative equipment, besides
the cost of its maintenance. The rise and fall of this surplus of
freight cars is set forth below:</p>

<p>These figures of the average miles per day of freight cars are
the delight of demagogues and other detractors of American railways
who ignore, or have never been able to comprehend, that the average
performance of a car per day depends from six to nine times more
on the time allowed for shippers to load and unload cars than on its
speed in transit. This speed runs all the way from ten to forty
miles and over an hour. But if freight trains averaged 40 miles an
hour it would make little impression on the per day average of cars
so long as 48 hours has to be allowed as a minimum at either end for
loading and unloading and almost as much more for placing notices
and disposing of cars, to say nothing of time consumed in making
up trains.</p>

<p>The salient and significant feature of this table is the proof it
affords that each car of those in commission averages the movement
of one ton 367 miles per day. This means an average load of 14
tons per car. It would take at least three English or European
freight cars to average such a load.</p>

<p>The second annual report of the government Block Signal and
Train Control Board shows that little advance has been made in the
search after the perfect system of automatic mechanical operation.
Since the organization of the board in 1907 no less than 835 plans
and descriptions of inventions designed to enhance the safety of
railway operation have been submitted for its consideration. Of
these 184 were examined and reported upon in 1908 and 12 were
found worthy of further investigation. During the past year 327
others have been reviewed with a net result that again 12 have been
found to possess enough merit to warrant the Board in conducting
further tests. It finds that the vast majority of the proposed
devices are unsound either in principle or design.</p>

<p>With regard to some form of automatic stop, the Board says that
it is not yet prepared to make a definite and positive recommendation,
but it thinks it reasonable to expect that several forms of
automatic train controlling devices will be found available for use.
In this connection it very sensibly concludes:</p>

<p>"It is not to be expected that trials or tests conducted by the
government will, independently of extended use by railways, result
in the production of devices or systems fully developed to meet all
the exacting conditions of railway operation."</p>

persons in their employ June 30, 1909, and their pay roll for the

$1,003,270,000. This would show an increase of 66,756 men employed
and a decrease of $48,362,225 in compensation&mdash;a discrepancy
accounted for by the fact that the pay roll in June, 1908, was numerically
at low tide while the aggregate compensation was swelled
by the large pay rolls of the first six months of the fiscal year. The
conditions were nearly reversed in 1909, for the pay roll was at the
ebb during the first half of the year whereas the number on it did
not begin to show the demands of increasing traffic until the very
close of the fiscal year.</p>

<p>These statistics would be more enlightening if the number of
employes was determined by the average from the monthly pay rolls
throughout the year and not as at present "from the pay rolls on
June 30." The discrepancies noted are liable to increase if the
Commission succeeds in getting the permission of Congress to substitute
December 31st for June 30th as the end of its statistical
year. Under the present practice, the summary which follows
reflects the improvement of business in the increase of employes,
while their aggregate compensation continues to show the effect of
the depression that prevailed throughout the greater part of the
year. When, however, that compensation comes to be divided by
the "Aggregate number of days worked by all employes" during
the year, the daily average which results is found to be within a
fraction of a cent the same as for the preceding year.</p>

<p>The aggregate number of days worked by the employes of the
roads reporting to this Bureau was 434,328,026 days in 1909 against
453,002,228 for the preceding year.</p>

<p>The first summary under this title gives the number, compensation
and average pay of the several classes of employes of the roads
reporting for the year 1909, together with the aggregates as reported
to the Interstate Commerce Commission for the preceding years:</p>

<p>This table brings out clearly the effect of the depression of 1908
on railway labor. While there was a decrease in numbers employed
in 1908 of 213,830 or nearly 13%, coincident with a proportionate
decrease in gross revenues, the reduction in compensation amounted
to less than 2%. This anomaly was due to the fact that the increased
scale of pay adopted in the winter of 1906-07 was only effective
during six months of the fiscal year 1907, whereas it was in full
operation throughout 1908, as it still is, with demands, negotiations
and arbitrations regarding wages all tending upward.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Unremunerative Expenditures.</span></p>

<p>Last year attention was called to the unremunerative burdens
imposed on the railways by the multiplying demands of legislatures
and commissions for reports on every conceivable feature of their
multifarious affairs. This year with the compensation of every
other class showing the effects of the enforced retrenchments of the
period, that of the several classes especially affected by these requirements
and the enactments relating to the hours and conditions
of employment continue to be the only ones marked by advances
over the record figures of 1907, as appears from the following comparison:</p>

<p>Moreover, had the aggregate compensation of these five classes
followed the general trend of all other railway compensation, the
expenditure on this account would have been at least $22,000,000
less than it was. This sum represents only a part of what the railways
have to pay for a system of accounting and reporting out of
all proportion to its published results. The public has no idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>

panic. Under instructions of the Official Statistician, these averages
are computed by dividing the compensation paid by the actual days
worked throughout the year in the several classes as nearly as it
has been practicable to do so. Although the formula is more or less
arbitrary, the system has been continuous and so the results are
reliable for comparative purposes.</p>

<p>In the statement following, figures for 1895, 1896 and 1905 have
been omitted to economize space, and because they present no
significant variations from the years preceding them.</p>

<p>The average pay of general officers for 1909 and 1908 in this
summary is out of proportion, for the reason that the returns to
the Bureau cover only 60% of the class numerically and include
all the larger systems. Before 1894, this class included "Other
officers," so the returns for 1893 and 1892 are not comparable with
those for this class in subsequent years.</p>

<p>Comparing the average daily compensation of the four great
classes most intimately associated in the public mind with railway
operations in 1899 and 1909, it appears that during the decade the
average wages of enginemen increased approximately 20%; of
firemen 27%; of conductors 20%; and of other trainmen, including
switchmen, brakemen and baggagemen&mdash;the most numerous body&mdash;34%.</p>

<p>An estimate based on the number employed and their aggregate
compensation in 1899, allowing 310 working days to the year, would
place the increase for all employes during the decade at 23%.</p>

<p>The relation of the compensation of railway employes to the
gross earnings of the railways, which furnish the fund from which
they are paid, and also to the sum of the expenses incurred in producing
those earnings for the past ten years, is shown in the next
summary, in conjunction with the operating ratio:</p>

<p>The significance of this statement is that in spite of all the labor
saving devices and economies of operation&mdash;reduced grades, modified
curves and more efficient equipment&mdash;adopted by the railways
during the past decade, the proportionate cost of labor to earnings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and to expenses has increased. It reached an abnormally high ratio
in 1908 because of the unprecedented recession in revenues during
the second half of the year. The fact that it has been above 40%
persistently since 1902 proves that labor continues to receive its
full proportion of the receipts of American railways.</p>

<p>In his award in the case of the North Eastern Railway, Sir James
Woodhouse fixed the following scales:</p>

<p>Firemen.&mdash;First year, 84 cents per day; 2d year, 90 cents; 3d
year, 96 cents; 4th and 5th years, $1.02; 6th year, $1.08; 7th year,
$1.14; 8th year, and subsequent years, $1.20. Firemen to pass for
drivers during the 8th year.</p>

<p>Cleaners.&mdash;Age 16 to 17 years, $2.40 per week; 17 to 18 years,
$2.64; 18 to 19 years, $3.12; 19 to 20 years, $3.60; 20 to 21 years,
$4.08; and an advance of 24 cents per week for each subsequent
year up to a maximum of $4.80 per week.</p>

<p>"That the wages of all goods and mineral guards be increased as
follows:</p>

<p>"(a) The wages of those who have been in receipt of $7.20 (the
maximum of the existing scale) for not less than two years shall be
increased to $7.44 per week.</p>

<p>"(b) The wages of those who have been in receipt of the said
maximum for not less than five years shall be increased to $7.68
per week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"The bonus for working with large engines on freight trains
discontinued when any guard becomes entitled to the maximum
wages of $7.68 per week."</p>

<p>Men working in the London district get from 6 to 12 cents more
per day than those in outside districts.</p>

<p>The award in the case of the Great Northern made an addition
of 24 cents to the weekly scale of the following grades: Signalmen
$4.32, $4.56, $4.80 and $5.04; passenger guards and brakemen $5.28
up to $6.00; goods guards and brakemen $5.04 up to $6.24; ticket
collectors $5.04 up to $5.52; horse shunters $4.56 up to $5.04; parcels
porters $4.32 to $5.04; carriage cleaners $4.08 to $4.32; plate
layers, second men and under men $4.32 and less up to $5.04; ballast
train guards, flagmen and greasers rates less than $5.04 per week.</p>

<p>An additional allowance of 24 cents per week is made to men
stationed in the London district.</p>

<p>From these figures a fair idea is gained of the average pay of
British railway labor. They support the statement that there are
over 100,000 railway men in the United Kingdom working for less
than one pound ($4.87) a week. The total compensation paid
British railway employes in 1908 was $150,248,000 against $162,440,000
for the preceding year. But whether the decrease was due
to a reduction in pay or in numbers employed cannot be told, as
there has been no census of railway "servants" since 1907. The
average pay may be safely approximated at $260 per year per man,
boy and porter, who two years ago numbered 621,341.</p>

<p>In 1907, Special Agent Ames, of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
reported wages on the railways of the United Kingdom as
follows:</p>

<p>Combined with a falling off in revenues and an increase in the
cost of materials this increase in the compensation of employes had
the effect of raising the operating ratio of German railways from
69.01 in 1907 to 73.56 in 1908. It also increased the proportion of
wages to gross earnings from 37.25 to 40.1% and had the effect of
reducing the net revenues from 5.60% to 4.51% on the cost of construction.</p>

<p>How railway labor fares under government ownership in a republic

to only 31.9 per cent. of the gross earnings, and yet they added
enough to the cost of operation to help increase the telltale ratio of
expenses to revenues from 64.99 in 1906 to 67.29 in 1907. The

enginemen begin at $22.50 per month and at the end of 24 years'
service work up to $38.00 per month; conductors earn from $15.97

<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">The Cost of Living.</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">What and how great the virtue and the art,</p>
<p class="verse">To live on little with a cheerful heart.&mdash;Pope.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Not because it has any legitimate place in fixing the standard of
railway wages, which should be relative to the part capacity, intelligence,
industry, loyalty and experience play in railway service,
but because in recent years the steady increase in the cost of living
has been made the fulcrum on which every lever to advance wages
works, is it proper to refer to the subject in this report.</p>

<p>Now there is nothing in the whole wilderness of economics so
utterly illusive and misleading as this same cost of living. It is
as incapable of statistical expression as the airy imaginings of a
dream and yet it broods over the domestic happiness of nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
with all the disquieting effects of a nightmare&mdash;and like every
nightmare it comes from eating too much and wanting to eat more.</p>

<p>In economics, beyond the barest subsistence, the cost of living is
not ruled by necessity but by individual choice. Each person and
family settles it along the lines of abstinence or indulgence. It
ranges from the "dinner of herbs where love is" and the virtues of
self-denial are nourished, to the feasts of Lucullus and Pompeian
profligacy in whose indulgence whole peoples have perished.</p>

<p>In every discussion of the subject first consideration is given to
the price of food. This amounts to measuring the cost of living
with an elastic string. The proportion of the cost of food to the
cost of living varies in every land, in every occupation and in every
household. It amounts to less than 40% in an average American
family, but each family fixes it for itself. Following certain well
recognized economic laws the percentage for subsistence increases as
the income decreases. For instance, in France families with an income
of under $4.80 per week spend 63% of it for food alone, whereas
those with $9.60 a week spend 53%. In England, families averaging
$5.12 a week spend 67% on food, while those of $9.60 spend 57% or
less. In Germany, a similar inquiry showed that families with an
average income of $4.23 per week spent 68.7% on food (excluding
beer), or 69.5% (with beer); whereas families with an income of
$9.60 per week spent less than 57% on food "excluding beer."</p>

Wright when head of the Bureau of Labor in 1903 anticipated for
the United States these results of more recent European inquiries,

<p>While it is scarcely believable that many American families
with incomes under $200 spent less than $100 a year on food&mdash;the
European percentage in such cases being more credible&mdash;there is no
reason to question the general economic law reflected in this table,
that "the proportion of income spent on food diminishes as the income
increases." But it is governed more by individual tendencies,
character and taste than by any rule or principle. Each family
works out the problem on its own account.</p>

<p>According to the evidence presented at recent arbitration hearings
in this city, American switchmen, as a body, belong in the
classes whose family expenditures are $1,000 or over. Irrespective
of the incomes of other members of their families, the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'arbitraters'">arbitrators</ins>
found "that the actual monthly earnings of switchmen in the Chicago
district, for those who worked full time <em>runs from about $80 to $100
per month</em>." This means over $1,000 yearly compensation. Therefore
they are in the class which spends less than 39% of its income
on food.</p>

<p>The average income for all railway employes engaged in train
service, that is, enginemen, firemen, conductors and other trainmen,
is probably above the highest figure in the foregoing table and therefore
the proportion of their income spent for food would be approximately
36%.</p>

<p>But accepting 40% as approximately the proportion of the pay
of all railway employes spent on food, it follows that it takes only
two-fifths of one per cent increase in wages to take care of an increase
of one per cent in the price of food.</p>

<p>With this in mind it becomes instructive to follow the retail
prices of the various articles of food as selected by Mr. Wright in his
inquiry into the cost of living in 1901 and adopted by the Bureau of
Labor in subsequent Bulletins. These for thirty articles of food
for the eighteen years 1890 to 1907, as given in Bulletin No. 77 of
the Bureau of Labor, and for the two years 1908-1909 as computed
from Bradstreet's index and other sources of commodity prices, are
given in the following statement relatively to the average price for
1890 to 1899 == 100:</p>

<p>No authority is claimed for the prices in these tables for the
years 1908 and 1909. They merely represent the tendencies in those
years, as found in official and unofficial wholesale prices of the
several commodities, and there are often striking divergences between
wholesale and retail prices over short periods. Eventually
they follow the same course, although not always in the same proportion.</p>

<p>Now let us see how the average retail price of these 30 articles
of food compares with the average daily pay of the four representative
classes of railway employes in train service for the ten years
1899 to 1909.</p>

<p>Here it will be observed the percentage of increase in the average
daily compensation of "Other trainmen" exceeds the relative
increase in the price of food, that of firemen almost equals it, while
that of enginemen and conductors is below it by approximately
8 points. But, as demonstrated in the table from the Eighteenth
Annual Report of the Commissioner of Labor (1903), a smaller percentage
of the income of enginemen and conductors is spent on food
than of those employes receiving lower pay.</p>

<p>Moreover as only two-fifths of all expenditures is spent on food
an increase of 20% in wages would take care of a 50% advance in the
average price of food&mdash;provided the increase in wages was not attended
by a corresponding increase in every other item entering into
the cost of living.</p>

<p>And right here's the rub with any attempt to measure wages by
the cost of living. Which is the egg and which is the hen, in the
matter of precedence. Does the cost of living lay the income or
does the income hatch the cost of living?</p>

<p>Economically and theoretically it is not up to the railways to
solve this world old conundrum. Practically they are called on to
meet every advance in the cost of living of their employes to which
in twenty years they have not added a nickel, and they are denied
the privilege, enjoyed by every other employer of labor, to add its
increased cost to the price of their only commodity or service&mdash;transportation.</p>

<p>Today the advances in the scale of railway wages awarded, proposed
and demanded mean an increase of from $60,000,000 to
$75,000,000 in the annual "cost of living" of the railways. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
advance made in 1906-07 added $120,000,000 to the pay roll of
1908. Combined, these two advances within three years mean an
increase of approximately $200,000,000 a year to the operating expenses
of the railways without adding a single unit to efficiency of
the labor factor in railway operation.</p>

<p><em>This is equal to an annual first charge of 5% on $4,000,000,000!</em>
Imagine the hue and cry from the press, the immediate injunctions
from Washington, the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'desponding'">despondent</ins> wail from Wall Street, if the railways
proposed to pour that much "water" into their own cost of
living without getting a mile of track, a single engine, car, or coach,
a cubic yard of ballast, one untreated tie or any semblance of improvement
or new facility to show for the vast expenditure!</p>

<p>And yet the railways have their increased cost of living to meet
just as the rest of us. Nothing they need and must have can be purchased
at the prices of a few years back. When you mention steel
rails you have named about the only railway necessity that has not
advanced its cost of living in recent years, and the railways have to
buy 100-pound rails where five years ago 80-pound rails sufficed,
and ten years ago 70 pounds was heavy enough for the lighter cars
and engines of the time.</p>

<p>But at the first suggestion of advancing rates to meet advancing
prices of commodities the Commissions were overwhelmed with protests
from shippers and the paring of freight rates down went on as
the prices of the goods they carried went up.</p>

<p>In ten years the price of lumber advanced nearly 50%. As a
cheap bulky commodity it had enjoyed a low rate in order to move
it and it was moved at the expense of other commodities. When it
was able to pay a little more toward the cost of getting it to market
the proposal of an advance was met with indignant protests from
lumber shippers and dealers and reversed thumbs by the sympathetic
commissions.</p>

<p>The railways pay more for their lumber and other material today
than they did ten years ago but they will have to fight for any
advance in rates to meet this part of their cost of living. It is
said to be a poor rule that will not work both ways&mdash;but the cost
of living seems to have only one way of working so far as railway
economics are concerned.</p>

<p>Just as a straw to indicate that high prices of food are the result
and not the basis of high wages the following table of comparative
prices in London and New York from the New York <cite>Times</cite> of March
27, 1910, is instructive:</p>

<p>The amazing feature of this statement is that the United States
produces and exports to the United Kingdom enormous quantities
of breadstuffs, meat and provisions, which constitute the chief articles
of food in London and which are sold there at prices from 20% to
25% lower than in New York. Clearly it is the high scale of wages
that fosters the high cost of living in the United States and there
can be little question but it breeds the high wages it feeds on.</p>

<p>It is humanly certain, though economically unsound, that wages
will continue to advance with the cost of living and will not recede
proportionately as prices of food fall. But both will decline together
when for any considerable period there is a surplus of efficient
labor for the requirements of American industry. Even railway
labor in the most stable of all employments yielded to this influence
in 1893 and 1894; and the prices of food receded to the low mark in
the following years 1895, 1896 and 1897. Not until wages took their
upward turn in 1898 did the cost of food begin to show above the
index average of 1890-1899.</p>

<span class="pfs100 bold">CAPITALIZATION</span></h3>


<p>According to the Twenty-third Annual Report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission the amount of railway capital, including
stocks and bonds "outstanding in the hands of the public on June 30,
1908, was $12,840,091,462, which, if assigned on a mileage basis,
shows a capitalization of $57,230 per mile of line."</p>

<p>In the face of all the fustian about over-capitalization of American
railways, this is a most remarkable admission, not only of their
moderate, but of their decreasing capitalization per mile.</p>

<p>In its report on the Intercorporate Relationships of Railways,
dated March 10, 1908, the Commission found that as the result of
its investigation the figure for railway capital outstanding in the
hands of the public, "Measuring the claim of railway securities on
railway revenues," reduced the amount "from $67,936 per mile of
line (1906) to $58,050 per mile of line."</p>

<p>Of course there was never any justification for using the larger
sum as a true measure of railway capitalization, for it was known
to contain at least 15% duplicated capital.</p>

<p>In its Statistics of Railways for the year ending June 30, 1907,
the Commission gave the net amount of railway capital outstanding
in the hands of the public at that date, "assigned on a mileage basis
as $58,298 per mile of line," or $1,068 more than the figure reported
for 1908.</p>

<p>As the computation for 1908 was made on a basis of 224,363
miles of line, this would indicate a shrinkage of no less than $239,616,480
in the par value of railway capital. It is needless to say
there was no such shrinkage.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Net Capitalization in 1909.</span></p>

<p>Following the earlier judgment of the Official Statistician, this
Bureau seeks to arrive at a fair approximation of the capitalization
of the railways of the United States through the reports of operating
roads and the capitalization of the rentals paid for leased roads.
This, in the more recent language of the Statistician, furnishes the
only capitalization that "measures the claim of railway securities
on railway revenues."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>Applied to the returns received by this Bureau from 221,132
miles of operated line, this formula yields the following result for
the year ending June 30, 1909:</p>

<p>An estimate of $25,000 per mile for the 11,870 miles of line not
reporting to this Bureau would add $296,750,000 to the above
total. From this should be deducted $150,000,000 for the sum
assigned by the Official Statistician "to other properties," and we
arrive at the following close approximation of the true measure of
the capital employed in the transportation industry of the United
States:</p>

<p>In computing the average capital per mile last given, no allowance
has been made for the 8,927 miles operated under trackage
rights for the sufficient reason that the rental paid therefor is
represented in the total capitalization just as fully as if so much
capital had been expended in the construction of that many miles
of line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the net capitalization thus arrived at
through a straightforward analysis of the returns of the operating
companies is in substantial agreement with the Commission's
report on the Intercorporate Relationship of Railways in 1908.
The construction of 11,000 miles of line since 1906 would undoubtedly
account for the difference between $58,050 and $57,962 per mile
of line.</p>

<p>Owing to the intercorporate ownership of stocks and bonds and
the consequent intercorporate payments of interest and dividends,
it is no easy matter to make an entirely satisfactory estimate of the
return paid to capital out of the purely transportation revenues of
the railways. But the persistent reiteration by the Official Statistician
of the fictitious aggregate of all the dividends paid by operating
and non-operating companies, covering in 1908, by his own admission,
$3,927,453,365 duplicated capital, justifies the attempt.</p>

<p>The operating income of the roads reporting to this Bureau for
the year 1909 is arrived at thus:</p>

<p>This $724,483,163 is the balance in the hands of the 368 companies
of the moneys received by them from transportation, or, as the
Official Statistician now calls it, "rail operations," for the payment
of interest, rent, other deductions, dividends, additions and betterments,
reserves, surplus and deficits. But before proceeding to
this distribution these companies received $200,725,696 income<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
from other sources, principally interest and dividends on stocks and
bonds owned and for rent of track, and a net balance of $5,410,338
from outside operations. The total of these two sums, $206,136,034,
may be arbitrarily applied first to offset the item of rent,
$120,784,982, paid for leased lines and track, and the balance in
payment of interest and dividends in proportion to the value of
bonds and stocks owned as above, viz.: 36% and 64%, respectively.</p>

97% of the railway business of the United States, except that
$120,784,982 of the income from other sources has been eliminated
from the account and applied to offset the rental paid by the reporting
roads.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the gross dividends declared were only
$226,791,289, which is 3.64% on the par value of the stock of the
368 reporting companies.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Misrepresentations as to Dividends.</span></p>

<p>The discrepancy between this condition and the official statement
as to dividends declared in 1908 calls for an analysis of the latter.
This reads, "The amount of dividends declared during the year
(1908) was $386,879,362, being equivalent to 7.99% on dividend-paying
stock. For the year ending June 30, 1907, the amount of
dividends declared was $308,088,027."</p>

<p>Two income accounts&mdash;one of operating roads and the other of
leased roads&mdash;for the year ending June 30, 1908, give a clew as to
how the Official Statistician more than doubles the dividends actually
paid out of transportation revenues. The gross total is made up
of these four items:</p>

<p>As these income accounts show that the operating companies
received $280,427,460 "other income" from outside operations and
sources other than transportation, and the leased roads received
$111,153,013 "income from lease of road," the source of the major
part of this fictitious dividend is revealed. The $280,427,460 from
other sources would pay the entire income of the leased roads and
leave nearly $170,000,000 to extinguish so much of the dividends
declared by the operating roads.</p>

<p>Modified as to details, this is what actually occurs every year.
In the year 1908 the total amount paid out of transportation
revenues on account of capital of the 97% of the railways of the
United States reporting to this Bureau was represented in the sums:</p>

<p>This total was equivalent to 4.15% on the net capitalization of
the roads represented. The rental paid the lessor roads constituted
the fund from which those roads paid their interest and dividends.
Further remark on the misleading and harmful statement of the
Official Statistician as to dividends declared in 1908 is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Adding to this $290,750,000 to represent the 11,870 miles of road

<p class="center xl"><b>$13,417,438,876</b></p>

<p class="center xl"><b>$58,031 per mile of line.</b></p>

<p>This is an underestimate by reason of the failure of a few lines
to furnish even approximate figures on the accumulated cost of
their properties. Averaging the cost of locomotives at $15,000, of
passenger cars at $6,000, of freight cars at $800, and of company's
cars at $500 apiece&mdash;their present cost rates much higher&mdash;the
equipment of American railways represents an investment of over
$3,000,000,000, and its bare maintenance alone involves an expenditure
of nearly $400,000,000 annually.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Physical Valuation of the Railways.</span></p>

<p>It is worthy of passing note that just as the railway companies
have shown their indifference to a physical valuation of their
property, the clamor of regulators and agitators in its favor has
subsided. The proposal lost its attractiveness to them the moment
they became convinced that such an investigation would put a
valuation on the roads so high as to take not only the wind out of
their sails but the last drop of water out of their mouths. To-day
the only insistent demand for this futile undertaking comes from
quarters interested in the distribution of the appropriation of several
millions it would cost.</p>

<p>Credit for the reversal in the popular and political attitude on
this subject is largely due to the valuations attempted by the states
of Minnesota, Washington and Wisconsin. The results in these
states may be briefly summarized as follows:</p>

<p>Even Senator Albert B. Cummins of Iowa has seen such a bright
light on this subject that in his speech before the Traffic Club of
Chicago last February he said that he would not be willing to make
a present valuation of railroad property a basis for determining
rates, "for the reason that it was more than probable that the
present capitalization of between fifteen and sixteen billions would
be increased to twenty billions."</p>

<p>In the Bureau's Statistics for 1908 it was said:</p>

<p>"If the valuations in Minnesota and Washington, made by none
too friendly commissions, are any criterions of what a national
valuation made under presumably unbiased federal authority
would be, the present cost to reproduce the railways of the United
States would be nearer $20,000,000,000 than any sum within the
anticipations of those agitating for such valuation."</p>

<p>The most striking feature in this table is the steady advance it
shows in the capital cost of German railways. In ten years this
has increased from 251,597 marks per kilometer in 1898 to 283,608
in 1908, <em>i. e.</em> 31,731 marks per kilometer or $12,282 per mile. This
means an increase of $991,687,440 in capital cost for an increase of
only 5,525 miles of line.</p>

<p>Returns to this Bureau place the number of stockholders of

1909, of the 368 roads reporting at 320,696. As only 182,046 of the

stock, this would show 1¾ stockholders for each mile of road and
would indicate that there are at least 415,000 stockholders in all the
railways of the United States. Owing to the incompleteness of the
returns on this subject and the fact that large blocks of stock are
held in the names of associations and trustees, it is safe to estimate
that the actual ownership of railway stock is distributed among at
least 440,000 persons.</p>

<p>In 1905 the Commission reported the number of stockholders of

<p>If the ownership of railway bonds, which is even more widely
distributed than that of stocks, could be traced, it would be found
that over a million investors are interested in the financial welfare
of the railways. This would give to each an interest of $13,000, from
which the average income is not over $520 a year.</p>

<p>The attempt of the Commission in 1908 to secure evidence that
the control of the railways was concentrated in a few hands by calling
for a statement of the "ten largest holders of voting securities" of
the reporting companies having established that nowhere did they
<em>own</em> a majority or an approach to a majority of the controlling stock,
inquiry along that line was dropped in 1909.</p>

<p>In railways, as in any republic, the latent power is widely distributed
among the many, while the administrative responsibility
is necessarily entrusted to the few.</p>

<span class="pfs100 bold">PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE RAILWAYS</span></h3>


<p>It is the reproach of our system of government statistics of
railways that their first concern is financial results, which the government
takes no thought to improve, and the harrowing roll of
accidents, and not the adequacy of the service and the steady development
of the means of transportation. Every month, almost
every week, the public is informed of the volume of traffic, and every
quarter the record of casualties is told in sensational head lines. It
is left for belated annual reports to record the public service of this
great industry upon whose progressive efficiency every other industry
in the United States depends.</p>

<p>It is not upon what the railways earn, but upon what they DO
that the whole industrial fabric of the republic rests. It is not upon
the dividends they pay but upon the traffic they carry, the net
income withheld from dividends and put into improvements, that
their success as carriers depends.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">The Passenger Traffic.</span></p>

<p>In considering the public service of the railways it is customary
to give first attention to the passenger traffic. This is not because
it is the most important branch of the service but because passengers
are numbered by millions, where thousands suffice in the
enumeration of the shippers, who frequently mistake themselves for
the entire American people.</p>

<p>In twenty years between June 1, 1889, and June 1, 1909, the
population of the United States increased from 61,289,000 to 88,806,000,
or nearly 45%. In the meantime the passenger cars provided
by the railways increased from 24,586 to 46,026, or over 87%.
But this does not measure the liberal provision made by the railway
for the travelling public, which is more fully and accurately expressed
by the amazing growth of the number of passengers carried one mile
from 11,553,820,445 in 1889 to approximately 29,452,000,000 in
1909, or nearly 155%.</p>

<p>Here is shown an increase of cars not far short of double the
increase in population and an increase in passengers carried proportionately
greater than the numerical increase in cars.</p>

<p>In the meantime the average receipts of the traffic have declined
from 2.165 cents per passenger mile in 1889 to 1.916 in 1909&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
decline of over 11%, although every item involved in the service,
locomotives, cars, track, stations, labor, etc., cost more. The
passenger service, except as precursor to the freight service, and in
certain densely populated sections, was unremunerative in 1889 and
is more so now. It is maintained at the expense of the freight service
by what the Railroad Commission of Wisconsin has characterized
as "a species of piracy practiced upon the shippers of freight."</p>

<p>The salient features of the passenger service reported to this
Bureau for the year 1909, as compared with the final official returns
for the preceding year, are shown in the following statement:</p>

<p>According to the monthly reports to the Interstate Commerce
Commission covering an average of 233,002 miles of line, the passenger
revenues in 1909 were $564,302,580, or $1,943,077 less than
the above revenues for only 228,164 miles of line in 1908.</p>

<p>The average receipts per passenger mile in 1909 are the lowest
ever reported for American railways.</p>

<p>Taken in connection with the official returns covering the period
since 1900, the above figures afford evidence of the confiscatory
effect of the 2-cent passenger laws on railway revenues, as appears
from the following statement:</p>

<p>Here it is shown that the passenger service rendered has increased
12% more than the passenger revenues. But more significant
than this is the column of yearly increases in service by percentages.
This utterly explodes the theory that passenger travel
is greatly stimulated by low fares&mdash;aside from some positive incentive
to increased travel, such as periodical expositions, the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition for instance, the effect of which is
clearly traceable in the increased service in 1905, which includes
the heavy travel during the months of heavy attendance, July 1 to
December 1, 1904.</p>

<p>The 2-cent passenger laws were passed so as to become generally
effective July 1, 1907, and their effect on passenger receipts during
the following year was such that these receipts were actually less
in 1909 than in 1907, although the service performed by the railways
was over 6% greater. Had the railways received the same rate in
1909 that they did in 1907 their revenue from passengers would have
been nearly $29,000,000 more than it was.</p>

<p>The several increases shown in the first, second, third and sixth
columns of the table reflect the general advancement in passenger
traffic. That of 45% in the average passengers to a train marks
the progress in density of that traffic which may eventually place
it on a profitable basis. In Massachusetts, where this density
yields an average of 79 passengers to a train there is no demand for
a two-cent rate statute, for the conditions have made a rate of 1.64
cents profitable. In the group of states consisting of Ohio, Indiana,
Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota, where the density
of traffic yields only 46 passengers by train, a statutory two-cent
fare becomes confiscatory because it costs at least one dollar to
operate a passenger train one mile and 46 times two cents is only
92 cents. Moreover the 46 passengers per train is only an average
and there are as many trains that average less as more. The average
has to be raised above 50 to yield any margin of profit on passenger
traffic. If it were not for the density of traffic in the New England
and North Atlantic group of states the average for the entire United
States would be well below 46 passengers per train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>The steady increase in the distance traveled per passenger
reflects the effect of trolley competition in diverting the short haul
passenger traffic.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy feature of the seventh column is the decline
of 98/1000ths of a cent in the average receipts per passenger mile
between 1907 and 1909, making a new low record after hovering
around the two cent mark for fourteen years. As noted above, this
reduction in the average cost the railways nearly $29,000,000 on the
passenger traffic of 1909.</p>

<p>In this connection it is interesting to recall that between 1888
and 1893 the Official Statistician, then as now Professor Adams,
made the following computation of the average cost of carrying one
passenger one mile for the whole United States:</p>

<p>It will be observed that the average receipts per passenger mile
in 1909 are below the computed cost in every one of the years above
named, except 1891. When the advance in the cost of everything
necessary to the service&mdash;track, labor, equipment, conveniences,
speed, terminal facilities&mdash;is considered, the practical coincidence
of average cost and receipts leaves no margin for legitimate profits.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Receipts from Mail and Express.</span></p>

<p>Closely associated with the passenger traffic of the railways are
the mail and express services. Although principally carried by
passenger trains, each has a special service of its own by mail and
express trains. But all are included under the passenger service.
The receipts from these two branches of the service during the last
decade are shown in the following statement:</p>

<p>Aside from the striking contrast in the percentages of increase
of revenues from these two sources, the most significant feature of
this table is the reversal it shows in their respective importance
from the railway revenue point of view. Prior to 1905, carrying the
mails brought larger, if not more profitable, returns to the railways.
Since then the returns from express have increased so much more
rapidly that they are now nearly 23% more than those from mails.</p>

<p>If proof were needed of the absolute falsity of the charge that
the railways are receiving an exorbitant rate for carrying mail, the
above table of their receipts from the service in connection with the
following statement of mail handled and revenues in view of the
finding of the Joint Commission of Congress in 1899 would furnish it.
After a thorough investigation of the subject lasting from August,
1898, to July, 1900, the Commission came to the following conclusion:</p>

<p>"Upon a careful consideration of all the evidence and the statements
and arguments submitted, and in view of all the services
rendered by the railroads, we are of the opinion that the prices now
paid to the railroad companies for the transportation of the mails are
not excessive, and recommend that no reduction thereof be made at
this time."</p>

<p>The increase in the railroad service since this report was made
is shown in the following statement of miles of mail transportation
by railroads, the postal revenues and the number of clerks in the
railway mail service since 1899:</p>

<p>Compared with the increase of only 41.5% in the revenues from
mail received by the railways during the same period, each one of the
above percentages testifies to a positive reduction in the rate received
by the railways for the service. And if the increase in weight
of mail carried in 1909 were known, the contrast between the service
and the pay would be more striking. In 1899 the total weight of all
mail was reported as 635,180,362 pounds. In 1907 the estimates
made from the special weighing placed the weight of mail carried
that year at 1,290,358,284 pounds, or an increase of nearly 105%
in eight years. By reference to the above table it will be seen
that the railway revenues from mail between 1899 and 1907 increased
only 40%. The contrast is illuminating. In its light the
charge that the railways are in any way responsible for the postal
deficit is grotesque.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Freight Traffic</span></p>

<p>According to the monthly returns to the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the proportion of revenues from freight of the railways
of the United States to total earnings from operation, for the years
1908 and 1909, receded to the unusually low figures of 68.51% and
68.88% respectively. The official summary for 1908, based on the
annual returns, shows a proportion of 69.17% for that year, which
probably is nearer the mark.</p>

<p>The annual reports to this Bureau for 1909 yield a proportion of
69.18% for last year.</p>

<p>Accepting this proportion taken from the annual returns as being
based on the same character of reports as those from which former
ratios were derived, the preponderance of freight traffic is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>

to total earnings from operation, 1899 to 1909:</p>

<p>The average proportion for the nine years preceding 1908 is seen
to be slightly above 70%, and the fact that it was almost one point
below 70% in 1908 and 1909 indicates that it was the freight traffic
that bore the brunt of the business depression which curtailed railway
revenues during those years.</p>

<p>In no other of the leading countries of the world does the freight
traffic assume the overwhelming relative proportion that it does
in the United States. In the United Kingdom it amounts to 50.35%;
in France to 53.64%; and in Germany, including express and mail,
to 65%. If these were classed with freight in the United States, it
would raise the proportion for that traffic here to over 74%.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that in comparing these statements of
averages for passenger and freight traffic, allowance has to be made
for the fact that the Bureau's figures include all the great systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
and are exclusive of some 13,000 miles of minor lines. It is difficult
to estimate the effect of these discrepancies with anything like
exactness. But complete returns invariably show a shorter mean
haul and journey for the entire country than the Bureau's figures
indicate and also a less train load of passengers and freight, the
result being a slightly higher average for passenger and freight ton
receipts per mile.</p>

<p>Last year from its returns the Bureau computed the passenger
mile receipts at 1.933 cents and the ton mile receipts at 7.53 mills.
The Commission's final figures were 1.937 cents and 7.54 mills respectively.</p>

<p>Mark the one column which shows a decrease. This means a
remission of almost exactly a quarter of a cent per ton mile in the
average receipts from freight. On the tonnage carried in 1909 it
meant a saving of over $540,000,000 to the shippers. In the presence
of the present high price of everything carried by the railways,
there is no ground for assuming that any portion of this half billion
dollars withheld from the railways ever reached the ultimate consumer.
On the contrary the presumption is unavoidable that it has
been absorbed by the shippers and consignors, whose profits are
greater than ever.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Proportion of Commodities Moved 1899-1909.</span></p>

<p>Referring to the movement of different classes of commodities
in his report for 1904, the Official Statistician said: "A slight change
in the ratio of freight carried for any one of the classes named may
have decided results, not only upon the earnings of the roads, <em>but
upon the average rate per ton mile</em>." But without knowing the
length of the haul of the respective classes, any estimate of the
effect of such variation must be largely speculative.</p>

<p>In 1909, for the first time the Bureau undertook to collect the
information as to the tonnage of the main divisions of commodities
carried. Its inquiries were limited to the tonnage originating on
the several roads, and the next statement presents the results in
comparison with the official figures for 1907, which are the last
available:</p>

in 1909 was greater than for any other year covered by these

<p>Having in the preceding pages given the facts as to the provision
made by the railways for fulfilling their obligations as common
carriers, it is now in order to present a brief review of their receipts
and expenditures in relation to their public service.</p>

<p>For the second successive year the Bureau has to warn the
reader that innovations in the forms of keeping railway accounts
prescribed by the Commission preclude the making of strictly
accurate comparisons of the returns for 1909 with those of any preceding
year. In submitting its report for 1908 the Commission
made the following explanation:</p>

<p>"A number of important changes have been made in the annual
report forms for 1908, particularly in the grouping of certain items
in connection with the Income Account and the Profit and Loss
Account. The figures which follow do not include returns applying
to carriers classed as switching and terminal. The changes in the
income account submitted in the report under consideration are
so far reaching in their results, in a number of instances, as to impair
direct or close comparison with figures for similar items contained
in previous statistical reports."</p>

<p>In the comparative Income Account below, which aims to
present the situation as it would result from the actual operations
had such operations been conducted by a single corporation, the
Bureau has sought to make the returns for 1908 and 1909 conform
as nearly as possible to "previous statistical reports." It should
be premised, however, that the official figures for 1908 exclude the
returns from switching and terminal companies, whereas the Bureau's
figures for 1909 include some portion of these returns, which
are as much an integral part of the transportation service of American
railways as any they perform. The official figures for 1908
do not correspond absolutely to the preliminary figures for the same
year compiled from the monthly reports as reviewed in the Introduction
to this report.</p>

<p>With this by way of explanation, the comparative Income
Account for the years 1909 and 1908 is submitted:</p>

<p>In 1909 the "Income Account" of the railways was swelled and
confused by including therein $200,725,696 of intercorporate payments,
while that for 1908 includes $274,450,192 "Other Income"
which, as has been formerly noted by the Official Statistician, swells
the totals to a fictitious figure. It is out of this fictitious income
that fictitious interest and dividends are paid, fictitious deductions
made, and fictitious surpluses accumulated. If "Other deductions"
in the above statement had been charged against "Other income"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
instead of being deducted from earnings from operation the balance
to Profit and Loss for each year would have been so much larger.</p>

<p>What becomes of the rent paid by operating roads for leased
roads is well shown in the statement included in the Commission's
preliminary report of statistics for 1908 in which the amount received
by the latter mentioned in the table just submitted is disposed
of.</p>

<p>Included under the blind item of "Deductions from gross corporate
income, $62,232,508" in this statement may be mentioned
rents of other roads and facilities of which these leased roads are
the lessees, interest on funded debt and other interest, sinking funds
chargeable to income and other deductions not specifically pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>vided
for elsewhere. In case of operating roads this item also includes
the balance of hire of equipment, to which, of course, there
is a credit with other operating roads.</p>

<p>The significant feature in this statement is the decrease in the
profit and loss credit balance of $16,662,887. But this does not
alter the fact that what becomes of rent paid for lease of road is no
more a concern of interstate commerce than what becomes of the
rent paid for warehouses or office space in any terminal. The operating
roads pay all the cost of maintenance of way and equipment. The
leased roads are not common carriers in any sense. They are simply
distributing mediums of the rents paid them&mdash;this rent being the
equivalent of interest on so much capital. As appears from the
foregoing table, the expense of maintaining the organization of
these leased properties amounted in 1908 to 35/100ths of 1 per cent.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that interest on funded debt and dividends are
paid out of the common fund derived from operation and investments,
the amounts devoted to these items in the above statement
are necessarily computations. That they are not underestimates is
proved by the fact that the surplus would not permit of larger
charges for interest and dividends paid out of net earnings. Any
interest or dividends materially greater than the amounts stated
above, not paid out of the rents accruing to leased roads as given,
must necessarily be derived from other sources than transportation
revenues, and has no place in railway accounts coming under the
provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce among the several states.</p>

<span class="pfs100 bold">TAXES</span></h3>


<p>So far as taxes are concerned, seasons of prosperity, depression
and marking time are alike to American railways. The burden of
their taxation knows no recession but mounts steadily, absolutely,
per mile and in proportion to gross earnings.</p>

<p>The 368 roads reporting to this Bureau owning 182,046 miles of
line and operating 221,132 miles, of which 39,086 miles were leased,
paid $82,650,214 taxes in 1909. The Commission's report for 1908
shows that the leased roads paid $5,881,352 taxes out of their rents.
Putting a conservative estimate of $200 a mile on the 11,870 miles
of line not represented in this report would add $2,374,000 to the
above figures and bring the aggregate taxes paid by the railways of
the United States in 1909 up to the striking total of $90,905,566.</p>

<p>How railway taxation has increased absolutely and relatively
to earnings and mileage during the past twenty-one years is shown
in the following statement:</p>

<p>In this table the figures for 1909 are based on the monthly reports
to the Commission and are subject to revision, but they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
in substantial agreement with the estimate on the returns to the
Bureau.</p>

<p>Observe that the highest ratio of taxes to gross earnings shown
in this table was 3.84 per cent in 1897, when everything relating to
railways, except taxes, was prostrated under the reign of receiverships
that followed the panic of 1893. It was of 1897 that the
Official Statistician recorded the fact that "70.10 per cent of outstanding
stock paid no dividends, and 16.59 per cent of outstanding
bonds, exclusive of equipment trust obligations, paid no interest."</p>

<p>There is instruction and warning behind the remarkable increase
in the ratio of taxation shown in the figures for 1894 to 1897. There
is the reflection of similar conditions in the rising ratios of 1908 and
1909.</p>

<span class="pfs100 bold">DAMAGES AND INJURIES TO PERSONS</span></h3>


<p>There are two items in railway accounts connected with the expense
of operation that give the management most serious concern,
because no means has been devised to limit or control them. In
a leaflet issued by this Bureau in September last, it was estimated
that the payments of American railways on account of "Injuries
to Persons" and "Loss and Damage" for the year 1908 would approximate
$56,700,000, or more than 2.3 per cent of their gross
earnings. The Commission has not yet made public the final figures
for 1908, but the returns on these accounts of the 368 roads reporting
to this Bureau for the year 1909, aggregate $56,379,024, or 2.37 per
cent of their gross earnings.</p>

<p>Divided according to the new system of accounting adopted by
the Commission, these returns show the following figures:</p>

<p>Unlike many of the other expenses of American railways, the
burden of this "cost of operation" does not fall heaviest on the large
systems. In the case of one road of moderate importance payments
on these two accounts amounting to 4.8 per cent of gross earnings
were enough to tip the balance into a deficit after paying interest
on funded debt; one minor but prosperous road, after paying 14 per
cent of gross receipts to meet these two accounts, had nothing left
for dividends after paying interest, which amounted to less than
10 per cent of its earnings; and a small third road after being called
on to pay 21.5 per cent of its earnings for injuries and damages had
only 6 per cent of its operating revenue left to pay interest on funded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
debt, which called for 20 per cent of the earnings, and taxes reduced
the net operating revenue to less than 4 per cent.</p>

<p>These are extreme cases but they illustrate how the "Injury
and Damage" claims strike roads that can ill afford to pay them as
well as the great systems which are the common prey of every
claimant with enough of a grievance to interest an attorney who
scents a contingent fee.</p>

<p>That the claims behind these expenses are largely meretricious is
indicated, if not proved, by their disproportionate increase in the
past ten years, during which the railways have expended millions
in providing safeguards for their trains and employes. This increase
absolutely and relatively to gross earnings is shown in the following
statement:</p>

<p>Startling as are these increases absolutely, those relatively to
earnings present a condition truly alarming, for which there is no
apparent relief except through a revulsion in the popular tolerance of
blackmail at the expense of the railways.</p>

<p>In no other country in the world are the railways held up on
bogus claims for damages to the extent they are in the United States.
Under the strict laws of the United Kingdom, as to compensation
for damages and injuries, the British railways paid less than 7/10ths
of 1 per cent of their earnings for all damages, losses and injuries,
or less than one-third the proportion paid by American railways on
the same account.</p>

<p>The significance of this table is that it cost the railways almost
one-third more for fuel per dollar earned in 1909 than it did in
1899, the increase in the proportion of fuel cost to gross earnings
having been 32%, due to the advance of 31% in the price of coal at
the mines during that period.</p>

<p>The effect of the anthracite coal strike and the Commission's
award of date March 18, 1903, upon the cost of bituminous coal is
seen in the sharp advances in 1902 and 1903.</p>

<p>The railways have not escaped the advance in their cost of
living due to the increased price of fuel any more than the public
at large, and so far they have not been able to shift any portion
of that cost, as manufacturers and shippers have done.</p>

<span class="pfs100 bold">THE SAFETY OF AMERICAN RAILWAYS</span></h3>


<p>Never before in the history of railways has such a record for
comparative safety been made as that recorded of American railways
during the year ending June 30, 1909. Following its custom
the Interstate Commerce Commission has published the report of
accidents. It remains to set forth here the more remarkable record
of safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of the 368 companies reporting to this Bureau, no less
than 347, operating 159,657 miles of line and carrying 570,617,563
passengers, went through the year without a single
fatality to a passenger in a train accident.</span></p>

<p>Of the remaining 21 companies, no less than 10, operating
27,681 miles and carrying 185,447,507 passengers, only missed such
perfect immunity by a single fatality each in accidents to trains.
This leaves 11 roads whose misfortune it was to bear the burden
of train accident fatalities to passengers during the year.</p>

<p>The invariable rule of the Bureau precludes the publication of
the honor roll of safety. And it is well so, for it would lead to
invidious comparisons, where, in such matters as accidents, all
comparisons are as irrelevant as they are invidious.</p>

<p>But it may be stated that the roll of immunity includes roads
in every section of the union, from Maine to California, several
great systems operating over 7,000 miles of line each, as well as
little branch lines of below ten miles of single track; lines operated
with all the safety appliances known to twentieth century progress
and lines operated under as primitive conditions as prevailed on
this continent more than half a century ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This record of complete immunity, stretching over 159,657
miles of operated line, represents a mileage nearly seven
times that of all British roads, and equals the aggregate of
all Europe, excluding Russia but including the British
Isles.</span></p>

<p>What immunity to fatalities to passengers over such a vast
mileage means may be partly realized from the fact that only
twice in half a century has it occurred on the 23,000 miles of British
railways, and never, to the writer's knowledge, so far as statistics
reveal, on the railways of any of the great divisions of Europe.
Certainly it has never occurred on the aggregate railways of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>It would take seven consecutive years of immunity from fatalities
to passengers in train accidents on British railways to equal this
phenomenal record of American roads.</p>

<p>In presenting similar returns for 1908, it was said that "considering
the myriad units of risk involved, the record for immunity
from fatal accidents to passengers is without parallel in the history
of railway operation." How that record has been not only equalled
but surpassed is shown in the following statement for the last two
years:</p>

<p>This table proves that the area of perfect safety, so to speak, was
extended over from 22% to 26% more units of risk in 1909 than in
1908, which already held the palm for immunity in train accident
fatalities to passengers.</p>

<p>The figures given above as to passengers injured in train accidents
are equally illuminating as to the safety of American railways,
for they demonstrate that with the multiplication of risks in 1909 the
number of injured was less by 4%. The fact that no passenger is
killed in train accidents is more or less adventitious, but a reduction
in the number injured testifies to a reduction in the opportunities
for fatalities.</p>

<p>During the past ten years the average of passengers injured in
train accidents on British railroads has been 580, which, considering
the difference in the units of risk, is 100% higher than the above
record for 159,657 miles of American railway in 1909.</p>

<p>The following table, which includes no less than six great systems
of over 2,000 miles each, presents similar data in respect to the ten
roads whose record for safety to passengers in train accidents is
marred by a single fatality:</p>

railways of the United Kingdom, approximately one-half the
passenger mileage, and over three times the ton mileage, with only
10 passengers killed in train accidents, to an average of 20 on British
railways during the past ten years.</p>

<p>Gratifying and remarkable as was the immunity from fatalities
of the class under consideration in 1909, the fact that for a period of
five years 95 American roads with a mileage practically double that
of all British railways have carried hundreds of millions of passengers
without a fatality to one of them is so at variance with the popular
impression regarding the dangers of American railway travel as to
seem little short of marvelous.</p>

<p>The impressive character of this showing will be better appreciated
when it is understood that the immunity from fatalities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
train accidents represents consecutive years counting back from
1909. No road has been admitted to the list where the immunity
has been interrupted by a single accident. With this fact in mind,
the clean slate of the 17 roads for six years challenges admiration,
especially as the Bureau's reports in 1904 covered less than
two-fifths of the operated mileage of the United States.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Railway Accidents in 1909.</span></p>

<p>Having thus shown the gratifying immunity from fatalities to
passengers in train accidents during the year 1909, and on 9,641
miles of line since 1904, it remains to present the reverse side of the
picture, which is so invariably thrust forward in official documents.

<p>The same cause which accounted for the remarkable recession of
railway casualties in 1908 was still operative in a more marked
degree throughout 1909, as evidenced in the above table. Here is
shown a reduction from 1907 of 68% in fatalities to passengers in
train accidents and of nearly 50% in those to employes. Even in
all classes of accidents the decrease is almost as striking. A drop
from 647 to 335 in fatalities to passengers and from 4,353 to 2,456
in fatalities to employes, resulting from whatever cause, should be a
matter for national congratulation and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>That the facts herein set forth should have no lesson for national
authorities beyond moving them to appeal for additional control
of safety appliances is nothing short of a national scandal. As for
safety devices, the railways in 1907 were practically as well equipped
as in 1909. The percentage operated under the protection of block
signals was 27.1% in 1909 against 26.2% in 1907, a difference
inappreciable as compared with the recorded difference in fatalities.
The government inspectors reported the equipment in better condition
in 1907 than for any previous year by fully 30%, and yet
that was the worst year in the annals of railway accidents.</p>

<p>An English writer (H. Raynor Wilson), his vision unobscured
by the propinquity of patent devices, has placed his finger on the
true cause of the reduction in railway accidents in the United States
in 1908 and 1909 when writing in "The Safety of British Railways"
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Experience in America during the period of depression that
has prevailed since the summer of 1907 shows that fewer accidents
occur during such times. There are not so many goods trains, the
men are less 'pushed,' they work fewer hours, and the careless and
indifferent are weeded out."</p></div>

<p>But we do not have to go to England for a convincing analysis
of the causes of the remarkable decrease in accidents on American
railways in 1908 and 1909. In the presence of similar conditions
Statistician Adams in his official report for 1894 penned the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Another explanation may be suggested for this decrease in
casualties to railway employes. The character of equipment used
during the year covered by this report was undoubtedly of a higher
grade than in previous years. A large number of old cars of abandoned
type were destroyed during the year, while there was an
increase in the better grades of cars equipped with train brakes and
automatic couplers. This, however, is a suggestion merely, there
being no statistical proof of any relation between a higher grade
equipment and the decrease of accidents to employes. It is also
probable, in view of the fact that liability to accident is increased by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the employment of the shiftless and unskilled, that the grade of
labor was raised through the discharge of so large a number of
employes. This latter suggestion finds support in the fact that the
ratio of casualties in the Southern States, where the grade of labor
is somewhat inferior, has for a series of years been higher than in
the Northern and Eastern States."</p></div>

<p>With a continuation of similar conditions as to traffic and labor
throughout 1895, the Official Statistician, having not yet accepted
the theory that violation of rules, carelessness and negligence are
amenable to patent appliances, emphasized the concluding suggestion
of his 1894 report in these terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"From the above comparative statement it is clear that the year
ending June 30, 1895, is more satisfactory, so far as accidents are
concerned, than any previous year. Reference was made in last
year's report to the fact that the marked reduction in the pay roll
of the railways, by which the incompetent and inefficient were
dropped from the railway service, and the consignment to the scrap
heap of equipment worn out or out of date, were largely responsible
for the greater safety in railway travel and railway employment
shown by the statistics of the year. The result of raising the character
of the railway service and grade of railway equipment is yet
more marked during the present year, and to this must be added
the fact that the demands upon the passenger service during the
present year have been somewhat decreased. It is also worthy of
suggestion, although the facts yet at command are not adequate for
confident assertion, that the fitting of equipment with automatic
devices is beginning to show beneficial results."</p></div>

<p>From that year to this the fitting of equipment with automatic
devices has proceeded with uninterrupted despatch. Where in 1895
only 27.7% of it was equipped with train brakes and 31.3% with
automatic couplers, in 1907 the Commission reported 94.4% equipped
with train brakes and 99% with automatic couplers. In every form
of mechanical safety device the railway equipment of 1907 was
incomparably better than in 1895, and yet the number of fatal
accidents to employes in 1907 exceeded those in 1895 seven to three
and to passengers three and four-fifths to one. In the matter of
deaths in coupling accidents alone are "beneficial results" traceable
to automatic safety devices. The character of the men in the
service, their automatic observance of regulations, intelligence and
alert devotion to duty are the best preventives of railway accidents,
and the conditions prevalent after the panics of 1893 and 1907 are
conducive to these conditions.</p>

<p>It is not likely, however, that the American people will welcome
experiences, even in homeopathic doses, such as we knew in
1904, as the cure for railway accidents. But from the lessons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
every depression, as read in the statistics of railway fatalities, the
American people have a right to expect their representatives in
federal and state legislatures to learn that the prevention of railway
accidents rests on the intelligence, vigilance and experience of the
man and not with the multiplication of devices. Automatic obedience
to rules will prevent more accidents than all the safety devices
that cumber the shelves of the Patent Office at Washington.
Invention, however, is easier to the average American than plain
everyday observance of rules. Besides the selling of devices to
railways is a profitable business.</p>

<p>As this report goes to press, the Commission, through the Associated
Press, has issued a summary of Accident Bulletin No. 34
which states that there were 1,073 persons (105 passengers and 969
employes) killed and 21,849 injured on the steam railways of the
United States during the three months ending December 31, 1909.</p>

<p>This shows an increase over the corresponding quarter last year
of 275 killed and 5,003 injured. For the same quarter in 1907 the
killed were 1,092; in 1906, 1,430; and in 1905, 1,109. As the quarter
ending December 31, 1909, saw railway traffic at its highest pressure,
it shows an improvement over the records of 1907, '06 and '05.</p>

<p>The number injured is the highest ever recorded for three months,
surpassing the quarter ending September 30, 1907, however, by only
126. But as explained elsewhere, "injuries" is too elastic a term for
comparative statistics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Accidents to Other Persons.</span></p>

<p>Where the quarterly Bulletins of the Commission make no mention
of the accidents to persons other than passengers and employes,
the annual reports of the carriers supply the missing data as to
"Other Persons." These include casualties at highway crossings,
to trespassers, persons walking, standing or sleeping on the track,
workmen in railway shops and all other accidents directly or indirectly
connected with the transportation industry. Accidents to
"Other Persons" cover over 60% of all fatalities charged to the railways
and of these over 80% are to trespassers.</p>

<p>The returns to this Bureau show the following casualties to
persons other than passengers and employes during the year ending
June 30, 1909:</p>

<p>These figures warrant the estimate that the total number of
trespassers and other persons killed and injured in the United States
in 1909 through the operation of railways was approximately 5,978
and 9,132 respectively. This marks a decrease from 1908, but not
nearly so great as in the case of passengers and employes.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Fatalities in Railway Accidents Since 1888.</span></p>

<p>We are now enabled to present a complete statement of the
fatalities connected with the transportation industry since the
Commission began compiling casualty statistics in 1888. The
figures in this summary are confined to fatalities, for the reason
given by the Commission that it "is well known the term 'injury,'
as used in statistics of this character, is elastic." As a matter of
fact the terms injury and casualty are so individually or locally indefinite
and variable as to have little or no statistical value.</p>

<p>To the most casual student this table illustrates how railway
accidents increase and decline with periods of business activity and
recession. The effect of the panic of 1893-94 is seen in the decrease
in accidents in 1895 and 1896. The temporary slowing up in 1904
is reflected in fewer fatalities in 1905, and a drop of 11% in the
business of 1908 was followed by a decreased death roll of 12% for
that year and 25% in 1909.</p>

<p>Here it will be observed freight trains were involved in 86.6%
of the prominent collisions of the year and shared in responsibility
for 79.3% of the fatalities. The proportion of injured in accidents
to freight trains is not so great for the obvious reason that the
number of persons exposed in collisions involving only freight trains
is generally limited to train crews.</p>

<p>An examination of the causes given for the prominent collisions

the passage of the Act of March 3, 1901, requiring the railway companies
to make full monthly reports of all accidents affords the

<p>Among the prominent derailments charged against the railways
in the Bulletin for April, May and June, 1909, is the following, resulting
in one killed and three injured.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Automobile running on track, derailed by running over a dog, one
guest killed."</p></div>

<p>Through the inclusion in these Bulletins of accidents on trolley
lines, their value as records of railway accidents is being greatly
impaired. Without any information as to the number of passengers
carried by the electric cars it is impossible to arrive at an accurate
idea of the relation of accidents to traffic, and without this the mere
record of accidents has little information value.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Accidents on British Railways.</span></p>

<p>For a second time in their history, in the year ending December
31, 1908, British railways went through a twelvemonth without
killing a single passenger in a train accident, thus paralleling their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
record of 1901 in this respect. In the matter of passengers injured,
the year 1908 showed a remarkable improvement, not only over
1901 but over any other year in the history of British railways.
When it comes to the totals of casualties, however, 1908 shows
little variation from the average record.</p>

<p>The following table shows the total number of persons killed and
injured in the working of British railways, as reported to the Board
of Trade for the calendar year 1908 as compared with 1901:</p>

<p>As one year of traffic on American railways approximates ten
years on British railways, the above totals for ten years on the
latter may be compared with 8769 killed and 73,052 injured on the
former last year, or with 11,839 killed and 111,016 injured in 1907,
the darkest year in the annals of American railway accidents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>Attention is asked to the apparently startling increase in injuries
on British railways since 1905. The increase is absolutely fictitious,
having resulted from "a change in the definition of a reportable
accident," and not from any greater hazard in the working of
British roads. This confirms the objection, expressed in the report
of the British Board of Trade in 1903, to any changes in the form
of tables extending over a long series of years that "admit of comparisons,
which any change of form would invalidate if not destroy."</p>

<p>It will be perceived that the mere change in the definition of
what constitutes a reportable accident increased the number of
injuries reported against British railways fully 50%. This justifies
the writer's view that comparisons of injuries in railway accidents
are of little value. Even the same injury does not affect two persons
in the same degree. One "hollers" and cries for a doctor where the
other whistles and goes on with his work.</p>

<p>The inquiries of the Board of Trade into the causes of British
railway accidents in 1908 confirm former findings that, exclusive
of train accidents, in the case of passengers "they mostly arise from
carelessness of the passengers themselves," and the same is true of
the vast majority of accidents to employes.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Overwork and Railway Accidents.</span></p>

<p>At last the statistics of the British Board of Trade furnish what
well nigh amounts to demonstration that long hours play very little
part as an actual cause of railway accidents. Under the statute the
Board requires reports of all instances of periods of duty in excess
of twelve hours worked on British railways. For the month of
October, 1908, the returns show 31,052 excess hours worked out of
2,773,891; and for October, 1909, 24,486 out of 2,695,036, or an
excess of 1.12% in 1908 and .92%, in 1909.</p>

<p>Now, out of 861 accidents investigated in 1908, only 16, or 1.85%,
occurred to men working in excess of 12 hours; and out of 804 investigated
in 1909 only 9, or 1.12%. This bears out the opinion of
a high English official, that experience "does not show any close
connection between long hours and accidents."</p>

<p>The following statement shows the relation of accidents to the
hours the persons involved have been on duty on British railways
for a period of five years:</p>

and reported on by British inspectors during the years 1905 to 1909,
inclusive, a majority happened during the first half of the twelve
hours for which the men were booked and 2.28% when they were
working overtime. In no instance was the accident attributed to

<p>These figures, representing a European mileage of 182,459, may
be compared with those of the United States in 1897 when it had
183,284 miles of line and an accident record of 222 fatalities to passengers,
1,693 to employes and 4,522 to other persons; or even with
the American record for 1909, when with a mileage 27% greater the
record stood 335 fatalities to passengers, 2,456 to employes and
5,978 to other persons. The excess of fatalities to other persons in
this country is due to the notorious indifference to danger and law
of all classes of citizens in using railway right of way as a common
thoroughfare for adults and playground for children. Despite the
elevation of the tracks in Chicago, the writer has seen scores of
youngsters scarcely able to walk playing on those raised tracks and
laughing at the locomotives as they went shrieking by.</p>

<p>In all comparisons of accidents on American railways with those
on foreign roads, it should be remembered that our excess of mileage
and freight traffic more than balance their density of passenger traffic
and that nowhere else on earth is railway right of way common
to foolhardy pedestrians and creeping children.</p>

<p>The Railroad Commission of Indiana is to be commended for its
efforts to enlist public sentiment against trespassing on railway
tracks.</p>

<p>Only five railway companies, operating 859 miles of line, went
into the hands of receivers during the calendar year 1909, as compared
with 24 companies, operating 8,009 miles, for the preceding
year. The capitalization of these five roads was $78,095,000,
against $596,359,000 for those financially involved in 1908. The
following statement gives the names, mileage, funded debt and
capital stock of the roads for which receivers were appointed in 1909:</p>

<p>From this it appears that the cost of regulating American railways
has increased tenfold in twenty years. Of this only $34,000
is chargeable to the increase in number and compensation for the
Commission under the Hepburn Act. Of the balance it was charged
by Representative Adair of Indiana in a speech in Congress last
January that $450,000 annually was for "Interstate Commerce
Detectives."</p>

<p>From the data here furnished it is possible to arrive at a close
approximation of the passenger and freight rates in the countries
named. The average passenger journey and freight haul in the
United States is nearly twice as long as the average for the rest of
the world. In comparing net results it should be remembered that
rentals and taxes should be deducted from the American figures.</p>

and the German Empire, for which complete statistics are available,

<p>The most striking feature of this statement is the number of
states devoid of railway mileage previous to 1870, which since then
the railways have converted into mighty commonwealths whose
resources have been multiplied "some thirty fold, some sixty and
some an hundred". And those to which the railways have made
the greatest prosperity possible are the states whose politicians today
are trying the hardest to muzzle the ox that treads out the corn for
their people.</p>

<h3><a name="RECOMMENDATIONS" id="RECOMMENDATIONS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">RECOMMENDATIONS</a></h3>


<p>In conclusion I would reiterate the following recommendations:</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Railway Statistics.</span></p>

<p>That the Bureau of Railway Statistics and Accounts, now a
division of the Interstate Commerce Commission, be transferred to
the Department of Commerce and Labor.</p>

<p>That its statistics be confined to the affairs of operating railway
companies, the only carrier companies engaged in Interstate Commerce.</p>

<p>That its inquiries be confined to the data necessary to furnish
the public with a comprehensive knowledge of railway conditions and
operations in the United States from year to year.</p>

<p>That these statistics be devoted to publicity and not to the promotion
of personal or official theories.</p>


<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Accidents.</span></p>

<p>That Congress provide for an official investigation of all railway
accidents in the United States along the lines so successfully adopted
in the United Kingdom, and not in a spirit of hostility to the railways,
as proposed in pending legislation.</p>

<p>This investigation should be through a Bureau of the Department
of Commerce and Labor, composed as follows:</p>

<p>One Chief Inspector.</p>

<p>Ten District Inspectors, one for each Interstate Commerce group,
appointed from Engineer service of the United States Army, with
the rank of Major. This would insure fitness and impartiality for
the work and valuable experience in regard to railway operations to
the Army Engineers.</p>

<p>Three Deputy Inspectors for each group.</p>

<p>Three Assistant Inspectors for each group.</p>

<p>Several groups might require four inspectors of each class, and as
many could get along with two.</p>

<p>Enough money could be deducted from the Interstate Commerce
Commission appropriation to pay these officials liberally, so as to
secure competent service, without crippling the legitimate work of
the Commission.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
